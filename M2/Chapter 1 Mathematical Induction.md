# 1.1 Principle of Mathematical induction

A proposition(命題) $P(n)$is true for $n\in Z_\text{+}$ if
$$
\begin{gathered}
1.\text{P(1) is true}\\
\text{2.Base on the assumption that P(k) is true for s positive k,P(k+1) is proved to be true.}
\end{gathered}
$$

 
 
Step 1 Define the proposition $P(n)$
Step 2 Prove that $P(1))$ is true.
Step 3 Assume $P(k)$ is true for $k\in Z_\text{+}$
Step 4 Prove that $P(k+1)$ is also true based on the assumption in Step 3
Step 5 Conclude that $P(n)$ is true for $n\in Z_\text{+}$
