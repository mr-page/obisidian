# Greenhouse effect

Greenhouse gases can ==trap heat by absorbing== and ==re-radiating energy== to keep the earth warm.
This named ==greenhouse effect.==

Greenhouse effect is a ==natural process==.
==Essential for animal and plant life on earth==
The current problem is that the amount of ==greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is increasing== 
Excessive amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere ==intensifies the greenhouse effect==. This lead ==global warming.==
# Greenhouse gases
Greenhouse gases:
- Water vapour 
- ==Carbon dioxide== 
- ==Methane (CHâ‚„)==
- ==CFCs==
==Carbon dioxide== is the most significant greenhouse gas leading to global warming

## Source of Greenhouse gases
The concentration of other greenhouse gases has also increased over the past decades. This is mainly due to ==rapid population growth==,  increase in ==human activity==.

## Progress of Greenhouse effect
The greenhouse re-radiated ==more energy== which from earth's surface
More energy trapped in heat in earth.
