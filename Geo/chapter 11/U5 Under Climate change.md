# Action taken by the Mainland
## Reduce emission of greenhouse gases
### Reducing energy consumption
- ==Improving energy efficiency==
### Using more renewable energy resources
Use more solar and wind farms will be built to further ==increase the share renewable energy.==
Electric can be ==powered by electricity== 
### Carrying out waste separation and recycling
==Separating waste and recycling== reduce the amount of waste treated in landfills and incinerators
### Reducing the use of chemical fertilizers in farming
Reducing the use of chemical fertilizers to ==lower emissions==
## Removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere

# International cooperation in combating climate 
China:

Rest of the world:
Suffer for basic survival needs only

## Reason why different viewpoint between different countries
- Different viewpoint over the share of responsibility
- Reducing emission of Greenhouse gases ==costly==. Slow down economic growth
- Do not have enough money and the technology

## Example of international cooperation
- Kyoto Protocol
- Paris Agreement

# Action take by other countries

## The Netherlands
Encourage ==cycling by building== 
## Japan
Requires consumers to ==practise waste separation to facilitate recycling== 
## Canada
==Increase the the energy efficiency== of buildings by ==encouraging the use of insulation== and the recovery of heat from ventilation(通風)
## South Africa
==Planting== 
## New Zealand
Set up an ==emission trading scheme that pay needed==

## Brazil
==Expands the share of renewable energy generation==
# Action taken in daily life

## home time
- Use less ==air conditioning== 
- Save energy by ==turning off lights and computers== that are no in use 
- Eat more ==vegetables== and less ==meat==
- Grow some ==green plants==
