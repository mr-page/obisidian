# Weather and Climate

Weather is the ==air condition of the air over short period of time== 
Climate is the ==average weather conditions over many years==

## Elements

- ==Air temperature== (℃ or ℉)
- ==Wind direction== (N,E,S,W)
- ==Wind speed== (m/s)
- ==Air pressure==(hPa)
- ==Precipitation==(mm)
- ==Relative humidity==(%)
- ==Sunshine duration==(hour)
