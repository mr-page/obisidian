# Affect of desertification

Desertification mainly found in the ==drylands in northern China.==
==Rapid population and economic growth== are the underlying cause of desertification in northern China.
==Low Rainfall== and ==overgrazing(過度放牧)==
The physical environment of most parts of northern China is ==harsh==.
## The physical environment of northern China

### Relief and landscape 
The relief in northern China is ==rugged==(凹凸不平)
Many Large ==deserts==

### Climate 
==Low Rainfall==
Most places have ==annual precipitation== below 800 mm

### Soil and vegetation
Soil is ==dry== and ==poor== 
Vegetation is ==sparse(稀疏)==

## Human factor
==Overcultivation==
==Overgrazing==
misuse of ==water resources and deforestation==
## consequence 
This lower ==land productivity== and lead to ==land degradation(土地退化)==
And Desertification happened

## Damage and loss
### Economic losses
Loss of productive will decrease ==food production== and cause ==poverty==
==Food== price increase
### Relocation of people
Land degradation makes the land ==no longer suitable== for people ==live on==
### Higher frequency of sandstorms
==Frequency and intensity of sandstorms increase==
# How to solve the problem of desertification in northern China.
## Better use of land
### Wise land use planning 
In drylands and areas which are under the threat of ==desertification and sandstorms==
Don't remove the ==vegetation cover==
Not to develop the land ==into farmland or grazing land==

### Afforestation
Planting to ==protect the soil== from ==erosion(侵蝕)==
==Straw-checkerboard(**草方格**)== used to check the ==spreading sand==

### Develop other sources of power 
Develop ==Eco-friendly energy== to reduce reliable on ==fossil fuels==
### Better use of water resources
Improving irrigation(灌溉) and using water-saving farming methods to prevent the ==accumulation(堆積)== of salts in soil.
==Overirrigation== will speed up evaporation → ==accumulation of salts== on top soil.

### Provide other sources of income
The government tries to provide ==other sources of income== to prevent people.
