# Chapter 3.1 Force
 In general a force is a push or pull in a particular direction. It is a vector quantity.
 An arrow is used to represent a force in drawings.
 The Unit of force is the newton(N).
 
 Force can measured by ==spring balances or forces sensor==
Different types of force:
## Contact force
### Friction $f$ 
Force which arises when two objects are sliding or tend to slide over one another.

The direction of friction is always ==opposite relative motion or the tendency of relative motion== between two surfaces.

For sake of convenience in calculation, We sometimes assume a surface to smooth
(Will not exert friction on objects)

### Normal force R 法向力
Force that acting Perpendicularly on an object by the surface in contact with it.

### Tension T 張力
When a straight is stretched, ==the force called tension T developed along the string== 

Tension always pull object along the string. If a light inextensible string remains stronger, its tension has the same magnitude at every point.

## Non-contact force
### Weight W
==**The gravitational force acting on the object by Earth**==
![[Pasted image 20240906000855.png]]

### Electrostatic(靜電力) and magnetic force 
Electrostatic force exists between electric charges
Magnetic force exists between magnets.

==They can be attractive and repulsive==

## Net force 靜力
When two or more force are acting on an object, all the forces can be added up and the result is net force

# Chapter 3.2 Newton's first law of motion/ Galileo's law of motion

## Inertia 慣性 
Inertia is ==the tendency of an object to maintain its **state of rest**(zero velocity) or of constant velocity==
![[Pasted image 20240906003021.png]]
## Inertia and mass
The inertia of an object related to mass
An object with greater mass has a higher tendency to maintain its state of rest.
$$
\text{Mass is a measure of an object's inertia}
$$
SI unit of Mass is Kg(kilogram)

The greater mass, the greater the inertia, the more difficult it is to change velocity.

**Newton's first law of motion**

$$
\text{Every object remains in a state of rest or uniform motion unless it is acted on by a net force.}
$$

# Chapter 3.3 Newton's Second law of motion
The acceleration $\mathbf{a}$ of an object is directly proportional to, and in the same direction as, the net force$f_{net}$ acting on it, and inversely proportional to the mass $\mathbf{m}$ of the object 
$$\mathbf{a}\propto \frac{f_{net}}{\mathbf{m}}$$

$$\begin{cases}
F=\frac{dp}{dt}, & p=mv \\
\end{cases}
$$
$$
{\text{When }m\text{ is constant}}
$$
$$
a=F-net
$$
$$
F_{net}=ma
$$
![[Pasted image 20240906130706.png]]
P is not the net force because the friction hasn't count


==**The net force $F_{net}$ and the acceleration are always same direction. And both can't shows velocity of object.**==

## Solving problem

![[Pasted image 20240906131932.png]]

For an object moving in a straight line, forces perpendicular to its moving direction always cancel each other out and can be ignored. 

The net force, if any, must point along its moving direction.

# Chapter 3.4 Weight and Newton's second law of motion

## Weight 

By $F_{net}=ma$
We get $\underbrace{ W }_{ Weight(N) }=mg$
## Mass and Weight

## Weight of fall

$$
\begin{gathered}

\text{When the man and scale are stationary,}\\
\text{the net force acting is zero and R=W. Suppose scale with
$a\leq g$.} \\
\\
\text{When man in the lift uniformly motion with }
a=0\\
W+(-R)=ma=0\\
R=W\\
\text{reading same as W}\\
\\
\text{When:}a>0\\
W+(-R)=ma>0\\
R<W\\
\text{reading smaller than W}\\
\\
\text{When:}a<0\\
W+(-R)ma<0\\
R>W\\
\text{readings larger than W}\\
\\
\text{When:}\text{Free fall :}a=g\\
W+(-R)=ma\\
mg-R=mg\\
R=0\\
\text{The man feels weight}

## Chapter 3.5 Fluid resistance

Fluid resistance increases with the speed of moving object and is zero if the object is at rest.

Suppose a skydiver free fall from sky

![[Pasted image 20240906145811.png]] 
He experience no air resistance and his weight w. Wis the net force. a=g 


Later, the net force become  $F_{net}=W-f$
$F_{net}\downarrow=a\downarrow$

After the fluid resistance same as weight
$F_{net}=W-f\implies a=0$
The V of skydiver is ==a constant speed called terminal speed==


Final, when the skydiver opened the parachute 
$F_{net}W-f$ point upward

parachute

![[Pasted image 20240906150556.png]]



Under the effect of fluid resistance, an object fall with decreasing acceleration until the acceleration becomes zero, and the object falls with a maximum constant speed(terminal speed)
When f=W, object fall in constant speed. By Newton's first law of motion.


# Chapter 3.5 Fluid resistance

Fluid resistance increases with the speed of the moving object and is zero if the object is at reset.

Suppose a skydiver free fall from sky. 

He experience no air resistance and his weight $w$. $w$ is the net force .
$$
\begin{gathered}
a=g\\
F_\text{net}=W-f\\
F_\text{net}\downarrow =a\downarrow\\
\Downarrow
F_\text{tnet}w-f=0\to a=0\\
\text{V is a constatn speed called terminal speed(終端速度)}
F_\text{net}=w-f \text{ point upward}
\end{gathered}

Under the effect fluid resistance, an object fall with decreasing acceleration(deceleration) until the acceleration becomes zero, and the object falls with a maximum constant speed (terminal speed)


When$f-w$, object fall in constant speed. By Newton's first law of motion.

# Chapter 3.6 Friction

Friction can act on both moving objects and stationary objects.

Consider a  box rests on a rough horizontal ground. Then a horizontal force $F$ act on it.

Remains at rest:
![[WhatsApp Image 2024-09-18 at 21.58.45_be4f07bf.jpg]]

Box is moving : $F>f_\text{max}$
$f=f_\text{max}$, it's direction always opposite to the motion of the box. No matter direction of $f_\text{net}$

# Chapter3.7 Newton's third law of motion


Newton's third law of motion

Force always occur in pairs.
![[WhatsApp Image 2024-09-18 at 21.58.45_90174a04.jpg]]

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
The action and reaction forces act on different interacting object simultaneously.

## Action and reaction pairs

We now knows that an action and reaction pair should 
- **Act on two different objects that interact with each other**
- **Equal magnitude**
- **Opposite direction**
We can't judge whether two forces are action and reaction pairs by looking magnitude and direction only.
