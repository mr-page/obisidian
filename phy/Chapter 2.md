## Straight line motion acceleration
### Average acceleration
$$\underbrace{ a }_{ \text{acceleration }(ms^{-1}) }=\underbrace{ \frac{\overbrace{ \mathbf{v} }^{ \text{final velocity }(ms^{-1}) }-\overbrace{ \mathbf{u}}^{ \text{inital velocity }(ms^{-1}) }}{t} }_{ \text{ time interval} (ms^{-1})}$$
- The sign of acceleration of an object does not tell the direction of motion, nor whether the object is speeding up or slowing down. 
- The object is speeding up if its velocity $\mathbf{v}$ and acceleration $\mathbf{u}$ have the same sign; it is slowing if it isn't.
# Chapter 2.2 Motion graphs
## Motion graphs of straight-line motion
### Displacement-time graph($s-t$ graph)
![[Pasted image 20240903201036.png]] 
This shows the displacement of an object from a reference point at different instants. The x-axis is the time axis while the y-axis is the displacement axis. **==(Just a function)==**
- If graph straight line, it is constant velocity
- steeper mean higher speed
- zero mean zero velocity


$$\text{The slope of }s-t\text{ graph}=\frac{\nabla s}{\nabla t}=\text{velocity}
$$
### $\mathbf{v-t}$ graph
![[Pasted image 20240903224544.png]]
The point of it is instantaneous velocity
$$
\text{Slope of }\mathbf{v-t}\text{ graph=} \mathbf{\frac{\nabla v}{\nabla t} }=\frac{dv}{dt}=\text{acceleration}
$$
- Straight line, uniform acceleration
- steeper slope, acceleration with a larger magnitude
- Zero slope, uniform motion
- The sign of the slope gives the direction of acceleration(positive above the t-axis and negative below it )

The area under $\mathbf{v-t}$ graph = total displacement = $\int v(t)dt$

## Chapter 2.3 Uniformly accelarted motion
 For an object moving along a straight line with uniform acceleration:
 For a = constant (uniformly accelerated motion only)
 $$
v=u+at
$$
$$
s=\frac{(u+v)t}{2}=ut+\frac{at^{2}}{2}
$$
$$
v^{2}=u^{2}+2as
$$

## 2.4 vertical motion under gravity
When the object X,Y fall under gravity,Air resistance will obstruct the motion of the object.
FOr objects with a similar shape , the effect of air resistance is more significant on hte lighter object.

*When air removed, effect of air resistance elimintaed and the objects ==fall with same acceleration under gravity*==

### Free fall
WHen X ==under influence of gravity only,==it's motion is called free fall.
All objects have the same acceleration when they fall freely near the Earth's surface.
The acceleration called *acceleration due to gravity(g)*
PS: $\mathbf{g}=9.81ms^{-1}$


**Vertical Motion under gravity**

When object X moves under the influence of gravity only, X accelerate downward at $9.81ms^{-1}$
