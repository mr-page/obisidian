 A man is pushing the two box, A and B act forces on each other. These are ==**internal force**==

When treating the objects as one system , we can neglect all internal forces and consider only the external forces (the forces acting from outside the system).

If string A connecting x, y are **light, inextensible and remains taut** 

**==The system will move with the same velocity and the same acceleration.==**
**==And the tension of every point of A are the same==**


Furthermore, two object are connect by a light, inextensible string that pass over a smooth pulley,
Having the same property
