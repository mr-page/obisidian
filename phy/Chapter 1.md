The displacement described by magnitude and direction
magnitude is the size of vector
Displacement of A to c
magnitude =$$ \sqrt{ AB^{2} + BC^{2} }$$
direction 
$$\tan \frac{AB}{BC}$$
# Chapter 1.3 speed, velocity and acceleration
Speed = the distance travelled per unit time 


Speed is scalar and it's SI Unit is $ms^-1$
$v = \frac{d}{t}$
Velocity = the displacement per unit time 
velocity is vector and it's SI unit is $ms^-1$
Instantaneous velocity =$$v(t)=\lim_{ \nabla t \to 0 } \frac{x(t+\nabla t)-x(t)}{\nabla t}=\frac{dx}{dt}$$

$$\bar{a}=\lim_{ n \to \nabla } {\frac{x(t+\nabla t )-x(\nabla t)}{\nabla t}}=\frac{dv}{dt}=\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}$$
The average acceleration of $t \to t+\nabla t$ is 
$$
\bar{a}=\frac{v(t+\nabla t)-v(t)}{\nabla t}=\frac{dv}{dt}
$$
And Instantaneous acceleration of t is 
$$
a(t)=\lim_{ \nabla t \to 0 } \frac{v(t+\nabla t)-v(t)}{\nabla t} = \frac{dv}{dt }=\frac{d}{dt} \frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}
$$

Furthermore,
$$\displaystyle v(t_{1})=\underbrace{ \int ^{t_{1}}_{{t_{0}}}a(t)\,dt}_{\text{The difference between }
v(t_1)\text{ and }v(t_0)} + v(t_{0})$$

For plane:
$$
a(t)=a_{x}(t)_{i}+a_{y}(t)_{j}
$$
$i,j$ is the unit vector of x,y axis


# Chapter 1.4 Error Estimation 
$$
\text{percentage error}=\frac{\text{error}}{\text{measured error}} \times_{1}00%
$$
## Light-gate 
A light gate measure the itme that an object takes to pass throught it.

## Error in measurement
$\text{Uncertainly}=\text{finest gradiation}\times \frac{1}{2}$
