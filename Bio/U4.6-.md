==Ingestion== take place at the mouth (Physical digestion)
==Digestion of carbohydrates==  start in the mouth (Chemical digestion)
==Digestion digestion of protein== start in the stomach (Chemical digestion)
==Chemical digestion of lipid== start in ==small intestine== (Chemical digestion)
==Absorption of digested food== take place at the ==small intestine== (by enzyme)



# Infectious disease
## Bacteria
==Affect functioning== of body by release toxin(毒素)
e.g : ==Cholera and tuberculosis==

## Protozoans
Live inside body and ==damage the cell or tissues==

e.g. : ==dysentery and malaria==

## Fungi
==Release enzyme to digest our tissues==

e.g. : ==Athlete's foot==

## Viruses
Non-cellular particles
Reproduce inside the cell and killed it when new viruses are released

e.g. : ==cold , influenza , dengue fever== 


# Prevention of infectious disease 


## By inhaling droplets expelled or air exhaled 
e.g. ==Influenza ,Tuberculosis==

Prevention
- Wash hand after coughing or sneezing
- ==Wear a face mask==

## Contaminated Water or food
e.g.: ==Cholera==

Prevention
- Dipose sewage and faeces properly
- ==Drinking water is clean==

##  Direct contact (kissing , touching wounds)

e.g. :==Athlete's foot==

Prevention
- ==Avoid physical contact==
- Do not share personal items


## Vectors
e.g : Dengue fever , Malaria

Prevention 
- ==Remove the breeding place==
- ==Kill the vectors==
