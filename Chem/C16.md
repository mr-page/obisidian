# Measure of acidity and alkalinity

# Calculation

![[Github/obisidian/Chem/C14#pH|C13]]
# Indicator

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Titrant in reaction will determined the indicator

## Methyl orange 甲基橙
<mark class="red ">0-3.1</mark>  <mark class="orange">3.1-4.4</mark> <mark class="yellow">4.4-14+</mark> 
| red | orange | yellow |

Use for strong acid [[C19#Titration|titrate(滴定)]] with strong or weak alkali
## Litmus 石蕊
<mark class="red ">0-5</mark> <mark class="purple">5-8</mark>  <mark class="blue">8-12+</mark> 
| red | purple | blue |

Use to detect the blurry adicity or alkalinity or neutral 
## Phenolphalein 酚酞
 <mark class="grey">0-8.3</mark>   <mark class="pink mark-border">8.3-10</mark>  <mark class="pink">10-12+</mark> 
| colourless | very pale pink | pink |


Use for strong alkali [[C19#Titration|titrate(滴定)]] with strong or weak acid 


> [!IMPORTANT]
> When strong acid/alkali titrate the solution contained strong and weak alkali/acid .
> Strong alkali/acid wil be rather to react with strong acid/alkali

## Other method to measure the pH 

- Universal indicator
  different colour in different pH
  Wide scope of detection
- pH meter 
  Displayed the pH of solution on screen
- data-logger with pH sensor
  Continuously monitoring the change inpH display the result in graphic form immmediately

 To reach the first endpoint, not only the $\displaystyle\ce{ NaOH }$ is neutralized ,but also the $\displaystyle\ce{ Na_{2}CO_{3} }$ .

 > ==In the first endpoint, the $\displaystyle\ce{ NaOH }$ are all neutralized.==
 > 
 > In the second endpoint, the $\displaystyle\ce{ Na_{2}CO_{3} }$ are all neutralized.
 > 
 > The amount of $\displaystyle\ce{ HCl }$ consumed in stage 1 is $C(HCl)\times V_{1}$
 > 
 > The amount of $\displaystyle\ce{ HCl }$ consumed in stage 2 is $\displaystyle\ce{ C(HCl)\times (V_{2}-V_{1}) }$
 > 
 > according the the chemical reaction, the mole ratio of $\displaystyle\ce{ Na_{2}CO_{3} : NaHCO_{3} }$ = 1:1
 > 
 > The mass of $\displaystyle\ce{ Na_{2}CO_{3} }$ = The mole of $\displaystyle\ce{ NaHCO_{3} }$ = $\displaystyle  \text{C(HCl)}\times (V_{2}-V_{1})$ 
 > 
 > ==The mass of $\displaystyle\ce{ NaOH }$ =  $\displaystyle\ce{ C(HCl)\times V_{1} } -\text{C(HCl)}\times (V_{2}-V_{1})$ = $\displaystyle { \text{C(HCl)}\times(2V_{1}-V_{2}) }$==
