> [!definition]
> Rock which contain useful minerals are called ores.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> More reactive metal , more stable metal ores(hard to extract and discover more later)
> More unreactive metal, more unstable metal ore (Easy to extract and discover more earlier)
## Metal abundance 
- Aluminium ==(most abundance metal in the earth curst)==
- Iron (Second abundance metal in the earth curst)

## Common ore
- Bauxite : Aluminium oxide $\displaystyle\ce{ AL_{2}O_{3} }$
- Haematite Iron(III) oxide $\displaystyle\ce{ Fe_{2}O_{3} }$
- Galena : Lead(II) oxide $\displaystyle\ce{ PbS }$
These are ionic bonding so it is brittle, don't conduct electricity

## Heating the metal ore alone 
Hg : mercury 
Ag : silver
 $\displaystyle\ce{ Silver oxide(black)->[heat] silver(silvery) + oxygen }$

## Heating the metal oxide with carbon(reduction with carbon)
Remain transition metal is more stable. These metal oxides do not decompose upon heating. such metal can be extracted by heating their metal oxides with ==carbon== 

Lead:
$\displaystyle\ce{ Lead(II) sulphide + oxygen->[heat] lead(II) oxide + sulphide dioxide}$
$\displaystyle\ce{ Lead(II) oxide + carbon ->[heat] Lead + carbon dioxide  }$\
The $\displaystyle\ce{ Pb }$ is orange when formed , and turn to yellow after cool down

Iron: 
$\displaystyle\ce{ Iron(III) oxide + carbon monoxide ->[heat] Iron + carbon dioxide }$

## Electrolysis of ==molten== metal ore
The main group element are more reactive then TM and their ores are more stable. Their ores are extracted by electrolysis which is ==expensive== for extracting reactive metals

> [!SUMMARY]
The metal must be molten or the ore ==are not conduct electricity because the ion are not mobile==

During electrolysis, ==purified ore is melted== and electricity is then passed through the ore to extract the aluminium from it . The extraction can be summarized by :
$\displaystyle\ce{ Aluminium oxide ->[electricity] aluminium + oxygen }$

# Discovery of metal
> [!SUMMARY]
> The gold and platinum is earliest discovered metal since it exist in free state
> The silver and mercury followed by because their extraction just direct heating easily
> The remain TM required carbon reduction
> And the major group element required the method of electrolysis of molten metal ore so the discovery of pure major group metal after then invention of electricity

# 3R
- Reduce
- Reuse
- Recycle

## Problem with recycling 
- difficult and time consuming to sort out metal waste
- The cost of collection, sorting and transporting metal wastes is high
- The cost of melting and purifying metal is high
