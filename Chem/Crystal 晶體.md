The solid which inner [^1]point mass(tiny object in certain magnification) arrange periodically in 3 dimensional space.

Most of the crystal are transparent or translucent 


# Properties of crystal

## Self-reliance 
The shape of crystal form in polyhedron by natural 

## Fixed melting point 
During the melting progresss, no temperature change till fully melted (No counterexample)

## Anisotropy 各向異性
The physical property of different surface (Local property of different position)might be different  
eg. the eletrconic conductivity 

# Classification of crystal
## Observation of crystal's geometry
## Testing 


[^1]: The size  and volume of point mass is neglible
