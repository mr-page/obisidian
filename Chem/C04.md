# Rocks and minerals
> [!definition]
> Rocks is usually a ==mixture of minerals==
> Minerals are ==naturally occurring substances that have specific chemical composition==

> [!INFO]
Metal ore is minerals but not mean Metal extracted is minerals

# [[C10#Extraction of metals from their ores|Extraction of metals from their ores]]

# Rocks containing $\displaystyle\ce{ CaCO_{3} }$

==Limestone, chalk and marble== are rocks which contain the ==mineral calcite==.
Calcite is the natural form of $\displaystyle\ce{ CaCO_{3} }$ 
# Action of $\displaystyle\ce{ CaCO_{3} }$

==Calcium carbonate is white solid==

It decomposes to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide when it is ==heated strongly==
This type reaction named ==Thermal decomposition==

$\displaystyle\ce{ CaCO_{3}->[heat] CaO + CO_{2}}$

## Different form
> [!EXAMPLE]
> Quicklime : white solid $\displaystyle\ce{ CaO(s) }$
> 
> Slaked lime : $\displaystyle\ce{ Ca(OH)2 }$
> 
> $\displaystyle\ce{ CaO + H_{2}O -> Ca(OH)2 }$

### Limewater
Calcium hydroxide is ==only slight soluble in water.==

When water is added to calcium hydroxide, ==saturated solution with white suspension forms(Insoluble Calcium hydroxide in the water).==

After the suspension is filtered, a ==colourless solution== is obtained. The filtrate is limewater


## In water 
==Calcium carbonate insoluble in water==
# In acids
==acids can dissolved== calcium carbonate
$\displaystyle\ce{ CaCO_{3} + 2HCl -> CaCl_{2} + CO_{2} + H_{2}O }$

As the ==carbon dioxide produced==, ==effervescence(泡騰現象) occurs==

## Weathering of limestone by acidic substance
$\displaystyle\ce{ CO_{2} + H_{2}O -> \underbrace{ H_{2}CO_{3} }_{ Carbonic acid } }$

Carbonic acid will react with calcium carbonated in limestone 

$\displaystyle\ce{ CaCO_{3} + H_{2}CO_{3} -> \underbrace{ Ca(HCO_{3})2 }_{ Calicum hydrogencarbonate } }$

==Calcium hydrogencarbonate is soluble in water==

## Test carbon dioxide
When $\displaystyle\ce{ CO_{2} }$ bubbled into limewater for a few seconds, a white precipitate of $\displaystyle\ce{ CO_{3} }$ form
$\displaystyle\ce{ Ca(OH)2 + CO_{2} -> CaCO_{3}  + H_{2}O }$ 
$\displaystyle\ce{ Ca(OH)2  }$ is colourless solution
$\displaystyle\ce{ CaCO_{3} }$ form white precipitate in water 

When ==excess carbon dioxide== is continuously bubbled into limewater, the milky solution ==turns colourless==, because ==insoluble $\displaystyle\ce{ CaCO_{3} }$ react with the excess carbon dioxide and water to form soluble calcium hydrogencarbonate==

$\displaystyle\ce{ CaCo_{3} + CO_{2} + H_{2}O -> Ca(HCO_{3})2 }$

# Test presence
# Calcium
Flame test : brick red flame given out

# Carbonate 
![[Test for the presence of carbonate in a sample.excalidraw]]
If  ==colourless and odourless gas== evolves and ==turn limewater milky==, ==carbonate is present== in the sample
