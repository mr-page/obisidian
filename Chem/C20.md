# Fossil fuels

## Coal
A black rock consists of over 50% carbon by mass, ==formed from the remains of ancient plants==
together with ==hydrocarbons , sulphur compounds , nitrogen compounds==

## Petroleum/Crude Oil/Oil/Natural gas
A liquid mixture consist mainly of hydrocarbons

The main compoent of natural gas is ==methane$\displaystyle\ce{ CH_{4} }$== 


# Refining of petroleum

the complex mixture consisting mainly of [[Aliphatic hydrocarbons]] and [[Aromatic hydrocarbon]]. 


## Separating of petroleum in the lab

Petroleum is usually ==not burnt directly== to supply energy.

It need refine, most of the compounds in petroleum are hydrocarbons. 

These hydrocarbons have ==different number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in their molecules.==

Thus, these hydrocarbons ==have different molecular sizes and boiling point==

### Fractional distillation 
	(Picture missing)
	
Heat the mineral wool soaked with petroleum very gently

The fraction with the lowest boiling point range distils off first. 

Then heat stronger, higher boiling point ranges distil off one after the other

- The less colourless , more viscous(粘度) and evaporates more slowly .Vice versa


### Refining of petroleum in an oil refinery

Petroleum will be ==heated about 400 degree and pump the partly liquid and partly vapour== into the bottom of fractionating tower


The liquid part (residue) sinks to the bottom of the tower.

The vapour part rises up the tower, cools and condensed to liquid

> [!IMPORTANT]
==Hydrocarbons with smaller number of carbon atoms in their molecules have lower boiling points. Vice versa==
