# Metal and non metal
## Metal 
- Usually shiny
- solid(except mercury)
## Non metal
- ==dull== appearance
- gas or solid(except bromine)
Graphite(carbon) is non metal but ==electrical conductor==
## Semi metals
- Boron
- Silicon
# Periodic table
Arranged element In order of ==increasing atomic number==

## Periods
The horizontal row 
> [!IMPORTANT]
The period number of an element = ==The number of occupied electron shells== in an atom of that element
## Groups
The vertical column 
Total ==eight main group==
> [!IMPORTANT]
The group number of an element =  number of ==electrons in the outermost shell==in an atom of that element

The element of same group have ==similar chemical property because of same number of outermost shell electrons==. This called ==group trend==
- Hydrogen doesn't belong to any group
- Helium belong to group 0

Groups:
- ==Group I : alkali metals==
- ==Group II  alkaline earth metals==
- ==Groups VII : Halogens==
- ==Group 0 : Noble gases==
The element between Group II and Group III is called ==transition metal==


## Group I : Alkali metals
- ==Soft== 
- ==low density==
- Reactive 
- React with water to ==form alkaline solution== and ==given out hydrogen==
- React with non-metals to form ionic compounds
- ==More Vigorous with down the group==
## Group II : Alkaline earth metals
- Low density
- ==Less reactive than alkali metal==(except beryllium , all less vigorously with water than Group I)
- React with ==non-metal== to form ==ionic compounds==
- ==More Vigorous with down the group==

## Group VII : Halogens
- ==Colourful==
- react with metal form ionic compound
- ==Less vigorous with down the group==


### Colour of halogens
- Fluorine : pale yellow 
- Chlorine : Yellowish green
- Bromine : Black solid 
- Astatine : Black
## Group 0 : Noble gases
- Colourless
- ==Very stable==
- octet structure or duplet structure

### Usage 
- ==Helium : To fill balloon==
- ==Neon : To make Neon light==
- ==Argon : To fill light bulb==
