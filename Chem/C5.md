# Atom
Atoms of different elements have ==different sizes and masses==
Mass number = ==number of proton + number of neutrons==
atomic number = ==number of protons==
## Protons(+)
## Neutrons (No charge)
## Electrons(-)

# Isotopes
The ==same number of protons but different in neutron number== called isotopes

## Relative abundance
The abundance of an isotope refers to ==the proportion of that particular isotopes of an element in nature==(fixed)
## Relative isotopic mass and Relative atomic mass
$$
\begin{gathered}
\text{Let relative abudnace be X}\\
\text{Let relative isotopic mass}
M_{x}\\
\text{Let Relative atomic mass be M} \\
M = \sum_{n=1}^{x} m_{n}X_{n}
\end{gathered}
$$
==Relative atomic mass is the weighted average==

# Electron shell and electronic arrangement
$$
\begin{gathered}
\text{The nth shell's maximum electron number is }2n^2
\end{gathered}
$$
The arrangement of electron is called electronic arrangement
