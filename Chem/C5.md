# Atom
Atoms of different elements have ==different sizes and masses==
Mass number = ==number of proton + number of neutrons==
atomic number = ==number of protons==
## Protons(+)
## Neutrons (No charge)
## Electrons(-)

# Isotopes
The ==same number of protons but different in neutron number== called isotopes

## Relative abundance
The abundance of an isotope refers to ==the proportion of that particular isotopes of an element in nature==(fixed)
## Relative isotopic mass and Relative atomic mass

==Relative atomic mass is the weighted average==

# Electron shell and electronic arrangement
The nth shell's maximum electron number is
$$
2n^2
$$
The arrangement of electron is called electronic arrangement
