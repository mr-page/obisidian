# electrical conductivity
The stronger acidity or alkality , stronger electrical conductivity.

Reversily, stronger electrical conductivity, stronger acidity or alkality. 

Therefore, we can use electrical conductivity to compare the acidity or alkality

# By reaction

> [!EXAMPLE]
>  1.0 M$\displaystyle\ce{ HCl (aq) }$ and 1.0 M$\displaystyle\ce{ CH_{3}COOH(aq) }$ are given. Add $\displaystyle\ce{ Mg }$ to each of them.
>  1. More gas bubbles given out per time 
>  2. $\displaystyle\ce{ HCl }$ is  a strong acid and complete ionizes in water 
>  3. $\displaystyle\ce{ CH_{3}COOH }$ is a weak acid and slightly ionizes in the water
>  4. $\displaystyle\therefore[ \ce{ H+ } ] \text{ in }\ce{ HCl(aq) is higher than \ce{ CH_{3}COOH(aq) } }$
