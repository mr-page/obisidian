# Defining strong and weak acids

Strong acid will ionizes completely in water 

weak acid will ionizes slightly in water
## Alkali
#Alkali

strong alkaline will [[Github/obisidian/Chem/C14#Dissociation|dissociates]] completely in water

weak alkaline will ionizes slightly in water
# electrical conductivity
The stronger acidity or alkality , stronger electrical conductivity.

Vice versa, stronger electrical conductivity, stronger acidity or alkality. 

Therefore, we can use electrical conductivity to compare the acidity or alkality

# Reaction

> [!EXAMPLE]
>  1.0 M $\displaystyle\ce{ HCl (aq) }$ and 1.0M $\displaystyle\ce{ CH_{3}COOH(aq) }$ are given. Add $\displaystyle\ce{ Mg(s) }$ to each of them.
>  1. More gas bubbles given out per time 
>  2. $\displaystyle\ce{ HCl }$ is  a strong acid and complete ionizes in water 
>  3. $\displaystyle\ce{ CH_{3}COOH }$ is a weak acid and slightly ionizes in the water
>  4. $\displaystyle\therefore[ \ce{ H+ } ] \text{ in }\ce{ HCl(aq) is higher than \ce{ CH_{3}COOH(aq) } }$


# Example question

> [!EXAMPLE] 
>25 $\displaystyle cm^{3}$ of  $\displaystyle\ce{ HCl }$ and weak acid given, their pH both are 3. 
>
>After diluted to 50 $\displaystyle cm^{3}$ , which of them have higher \[$\displaystyle\ce{ H+(aq) }$]

> [!FAQ] Answer
> $\displaystyle\ce{ HCl }$ are strong acid and ionizes completely in water, 
> weak acid ionizes are slightly soluble in wtaer,
> some unionized weak acid will ionzies to give additional $\displaystyle\ce{ H+(aq) }$ ionizes . Produce more $\displaystyle\ce{ H+(aq) }$, pH less extended
> 

> [!EXAMPLE]
>  Distinguish the strong acid and weak acid with same volume and pH

> [!FAQ] Answer
>  Strong acid are ionizes completely in water ,
>  weak acid are ionizes slightly in water. 
>  Some unionized weak acid will ionizes to give additional $\displaystyle\ce{ H+(aq) }$ ionizes. Produce more $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ (aq) }$, pH less extended 
>   So ==the method to distinguish strong acid and weak acid is dilute them by 10 times and test their pH. the lower pH solution is weak acid while the higher pH is strogn acid== 

> [!NOTE]
>  We can't distinguish the strong acid and weak acid by adding Magnesium into them while ==they are same pH==
