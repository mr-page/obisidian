# Another side of acid 
$\displaystyle\ce{ CH_{3}COOH(aq)}$ is acidic 
but $\displaystyle\ce{ CH_{3}COONa(aq) }$ is alkaline 
because $\displaystyle\ce{ CH_{3}COO- }$ rather to ionize the water and react with $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$, left $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$
whether $\displaystyle\ce{ Na+ }$ doesn't tend to react with $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$ or $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$


# Strong and weak acid
