# Standard Temperature and pressure
- 25 celcius degree

# Gas volume
Under STP,  1 mol of any gas is volume for 22.4 L (volume)


# Another side of acid 
$\displaystyle\ce{ CH_{3}COOH(aq)}$ is acidic 
but $\displaystyle\ce{ CH_{3}COONa(aq) }$ is alkaline 
because $\displaystyle\ce{ CH_{3}COO- }$ rather to ionize the water and react with $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$, left $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$
whether $\displaystyle\ce{ Na+ }$ doesn't tend to react with $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$ or $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$



# Symbol related to molarity, mole, 




# The reason burn hydrogen gas 
Hydrogen is a flammable gas. When it reaches a certain concentration range in the air, it will explode when it encounters a fire source. Excess hydrogen is burned in the device to prevent unreacted hydrogen from accumulating in the device and triggering an explosion after reaching the explosion limit, thus ensuring the safety of the experiment.
