# Corrosion of metals
Refers to the ==reaction of metals with oxygen, water or other substances== in the environment. It leads to the deterioration of metals. ==When a metal corrodes, metal atoms at the surface change to metal ions==

> [!SUMMARY]
> The ==reaction of metals with oxygen, water or other substances== in the environment, leading to the gradual deterioration of metals, is called ==corrosion of metals==

# Rusting
The ==corrosion of iron== that occurs when iron reacts with ==oxygen and water== which is necessary condition

> [!SUMMARY]
> For rusting to occur, both ==oxygen== and ==water== are needed.

The process of rusting:
$$
\begin{gathered}
\text{Iron form Iron(II)} ion\\
\ce{ Fe(s) -> Fe^{2}+(aq)+ 2e- }\\
\text{dissolved oxygen and water accept electron to form hydroixde ions}\\
\ce{ O_{2}(g) + 2H_{2}O(l) +4e- ->4OH-(aq) }\\
\text{Iron(II)(aq) and hydroixde(aq) form $\displaystyle\ce{ Fe(OH)2(s) }$}\\
\ce{ Fe^{2}+(aq) + 2OH-(aq) -> Fe(OH)2(s)(Green preicipitate) }\\
\text{$\displaystyle\ce{ Fe(OH)2(s) }$ further reacts with and water, forming iron(III) Hydroxide}\\
\ce{ 4Fe(OH)2(s) +O_{2}(g) +2H_{2}O(l) -> 4Fe(OH)_{3}(s) (brown precipitate)}\\
\text{further reaction}\\
\ce{ Fe(OH)_{3} -> Fe_{2}O_{3} \cdot nH_{2}O(s) }
\end{gathered}
$$

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ==overall equation== can be represented by:
> $$
> \ce{ 4Fe(s) + 3O_{2}(g) +2nH_{2}O(l) -> 2Fe_{2}O_{3}\cdot nH_{2}O(s) }
> $$

The rust ==loosely attached== to the iron surface. ==The iron then become brittle== since it become ionic compound

# Investigating rusting by rust indicator

## detect $\ce{ OH- }$
Phenolphthalein $\ce{ C20H14O_{4} }$ is ==colourless solution, turn to pink== when react with $\ce{ OH- }$

## detect $\ce{ Fe^{2}+ }$
Potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) $\ce{ K_{3}Fe(CN)6 }$ is a ==yellow solution, turn to blue== when react with $\ce{ Fe^{2}+ }$




## Speed up rusting
$\ce{ NaCl(aq) }$ is ==mobile ion== and it can ==increase the electrical conductivity==

---
# Factor of speeding up rusting

## Acidic substance
==Acid speed up== the formation of $\ce{ Fe^{2}+(aq) }$

## Soluble ionic compounds
==Increase the conductivity== of solution and will ==speed up the formation of ion==

## High temperature
==Increase the rate== of chemical reaction

## Attachment of less reactive metals to iron
==Lead iron to lose electron more readily==

## Scratched, bent or sharp area of an iron object
The ==surface area will rust faster==

---
## Prevent from rusting 

### Coating with paint
==Cheap and simple way, easily scratched==

### Coating with plastic
==Make iron objects more appealing and last longer==. More ==expensive== than painting, easily scratched

### Coating with oil or grease
Use on moving part of machines, serve as a ==lubricant==

### Galvanizing (zinc-plating)
==Coating the surface of iron with a thin layer of zinc.==
Iron coated with zinc called ==galvanized iron==
==TOXIC==

### Tin-plating
==Coating the surface of iron with a thin layer of tin.==
==Tin is corrosion resistant.==
==Tin metal and tin ions are non-poisonous==

### Electroplating
An ==electrical progress== in which a thin layer of metal is plated on an object. usually chromium
==Quite expensive==

---
## Sacrificial protection

### Galvanized iron
If the ==coating is partly scratched==, the exposed iron will not rust.
Zinc is ==more reactive than Iron==, lose electrons instead of iron

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ==Zinc ion are poisonous==

### Attaching zinc blocks to ship hulls
Zinc is ==more reactive than Iron==, lose electrons instead of iron
==and the zinc block needs to be replaced before they have completely corroded==

### Connecting magnesium blocks to underground pipeline
![[connecting magnesium blocks to underground pipeline.excalidraw]]
Magnesium is ==more reactive than iron==, ==magnesium will lose electrons (corrode)== instead of iron.
Magnesium block need to be replaced from time to time.

### Cathodic protection
![[Cathodic protection.excalidraw]]
An iron object ==connected to the negative terminal of a battery of power supply==
while ==conductor is connected to the positive terminal==
Battery ==provides electrons to the iron object== prevent forming iron(II)

### Alloying

> [!definition]
> ==Stainless steel== is an alloy of iron made by ==mixing iron with specific amount of carbon and other metals (e.g. chromium and nickel)==

Most expensive

# Corrosion resistance of aluminium

## protective oxide layer on Al
$$
\ce{ 4Al(s) +3O_{2}(g)->2Al_{2}O3(s) }
$$

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ==Aluminium oxide is impermeable to both oxygen and water==, prevent Al underneath further reaction

However, the oxide layer very thin,
So we thickened it by ==anodization== to enhances the corrosion resistance of aluminium

### Thickening the protective oxide on Al
![[Anodization.excalidraw]]
The Aluminium object to be anodized is connected to the positive terminal
The overall reaction:
$$
\ce{ 2Al(s) +3H_{2}O(l)-> Al_{2}O_{3}(s) +3H_{2}(g) }
$$

### advantage of using Al anodization
- ==More corrosion resistant==
- ==Hardness of Al object increase==
- Al object can ==dyed==
