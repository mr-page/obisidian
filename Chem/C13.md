# Corrosion of metals 
Refers to the ==reaction of metals with oxygen, water or other substances== in the environment. It lead to the  deterioration of metals. ==When a metal corrodes, metal atoms at the surface change to metal ions== 

> [!SUMMARY]
>  The reaction of metals with oxygen, water or other substances in the environment, leading to the gradual deterioration of metals, called ==corrosion of metals== 

# Rusting
The corrosion of iron that iron react with ==Oxygen and water== which is necessary condition

> [!SUMMARY]
> For rusting to occur , both air(oxygen) and water are needed. 

The process of rusting 
$$
\begin{gathered}
\text{Iron form Iron(II)} ion\\
\ce{ Fe(s) -> Fe^{2}+(aq)+ 2e- }\\
\text{ dissolved oxygen and water accept electron to form hydroixde ions}\\
\ce{ o_{2}(g) + 2H_{2}O(\l) +4e- ->4Oh-(aq)) }\\
\text{Iron(II)(aq) and hydroixde(aq) form $\displaystyle\ce{ Fe(OH)2(s) }$}\\
\ce{ Fe^{2}+(aq) + 2Oh-(aq) -> Fe(OH)2(s)(Green preicipitate) }\\
\text{$\displaystyle\ce{ Fe^{2}+(OH)2(s) }$ further reacts with and water, forming iron(III) Hydroxide}\\
\ce{ 4Fe(OH)2(s) +O_{2}(g) +2H_{2}O(\l) -> 4Fe(OH)_{3}(s) (brown precipitate)}\\
\text{further reaction}\\
\ce{ Fe(OH)_{3}\dots -> \dots Fe_{2}O_{3} \cdot nH_{2}O(s) }
\end{gathered}

==overall equation can be represented by 
$\displaystyle\ce{ 4Fe(s) + 3O_{2}(g) +2nH_{2}O(\l) -> 2Fe_{2}O_{3}\cdot nH_{2}O(s) }$==

The rust loosely attached(鬆散地附著) to the iron surface. ==The iron then become brittle== since it become ionic compound

# Investigating rusting by rust indicator
 Rust indicator 
## detect $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$
Phenolphthalein $\displaystyle\ce{ C20H14O_{4} }$ is ==colourless solution, turn to pink== when react with $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$ 
## detect $\displaystyle\ce{ Fe^{2}+ }$
Potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) $\displaystyle\ce{ K_{3}Fe(CN)6 }$ is a yellow solution, turn to blue when react with $\displaystyle\ce{ Fe^{2}+ }$ 
## Speed up rusting 
$\displaystyle\ce{ NaCl(aq) }$ is mobile ion and it can increase the electrical conductivity

# Factor of speeding up rusting
## Acidic substance
Acid speed up the formation of $\displaystyle\ce{ Fe^{2}+(aq) }$ 
## Soluble ionic compounds
Increase the conductivity of solution and will speed up the formation of ion
## High temperature 
Increase the rate of chemical reaction
## Attachment of less reactive metals to iron
Lead iron to lose electron more readily
## Scratched, bent or sharp area of an iron object
The surface area will rust faster

---
## Prevent from rusting
## Apply a protective layer
### Coating with paint
==Cheap and simple way, easily scratched==
### Coating with plastic 
==make iron objects more appealing and last longer==. More ==expensive== than painting, easily scratched
### Coating with oil or grease
Use on moving part of machines, serve as a ==lubricant(==潤滑油)
### Galvanizing(zinc-plating) 
Galvanizing is ==coating the surface of iron with a thin layer of zinc.==
Iron coated with zinc called ==galvanized iron== 
==TOXIC==
### Tin-plating
Coating the surface of iron with a thin layer of tin.
==Tin is corrosion resistant.==
==Tin metal and tin ions are non-poisonous==
## Electroplating 電鍍
An ==electrical progress== in which a thin layer of metal is plated on an object. usually chromium
==Quite expensive==

---

## Sacrificial protection
## Galvanized iron
If the ==coating is partly scratched== , the exposed iron will not rust.
$\displaystyle\therefore$ Zinc is more reactive than Iron, lose electrons instead of iron
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Zinc ion are poisonous

## Attaching zinc blocks to ship hulls
$\displaystyle\therefore$ Zinc is more reactive than Iron, lose electrons instead of iron
==and the zinc block needs to be replaced before they have completely corroded==
## Connecting magnesium blocks to underground pipeline
![[connecting magnesium blocks to underground pipeline.excalidraw]]
Magnesium is more reactive than iron, ==magnesium will lose electrons(corrode)==
instead of iron.
Magnesium block need to be replaced from time to time.
## Cathodic protection 陰極保護
![[Cathodic protection.excalidraw]]
An iron object ==connected to the negative terminal of a battery of power supply==
while ==conductor is connected to the positive terminal==
Battery ==provides electrons to the iron object== prevent forming iron(II)
## Alloying

> [!definition]
> ==Stainless steel== is an alloy of iron made by ==mixing iron with specific amount of carbon and other metals(e.g. chromium and nickel)==

Most expensive
# Corrosion resistance of aluminium
# protective oxide layer on Al

$\displaystyle\ce{ 4Al(s) +3O_{2}(g)->2Al_{2}O3(s) }$
> [!IMPORTANT]
==Aluminium oxide is impermeable to both oxygen and water , prevent Al underneath further reaction==

However, the oxide layer very thin,
So we thickened it by ==anodization(陽極保護)== to enhances the corrosion resistance of aluminium
### Thickening the protective oxide on Al
![[Anodization.excalidraw]]
The Aluminium object to be anodized is connected to the positive terminal
The overall reaction:
$\displaystyle\ce{ 2Al(s) +3H_{2}O(\l)-> Al_{2}O_{3}(s) +3H_{2}(g) }$
### advantage of using Al anodization
- ==More corrosion resistant==
- ==Hardness of Al object increase==
- Al object can ==dyed==
