# Acid-alkaline titration
Titration to find the solution required to neutral the solution which known for the component. 


## Burette

> [!IMPORTANT] Reason why use burette
> Test tube are low capacity and have no scale to measure the solution dropped, therefore use burette instead of test tube



The burette hold by stand and burette clamp

### Acidity Burette

There is a valve to control the flowing of solution
It can be used to contain the ==[[Oxidation|oxidizing]] and acidic== solution
### Alkaline Burette

Apart of alkaline burette is made by rubber which containing a glass ball to control the flowing of solution by extrude.
It can be used to contain the ==[[Reducibility|reducibility]] and alkaline== solution
Don't use alkaline burettes for organic solutions.
## Preparation of burette 
### 1. Check if any laekage
Close the piston (valve for acidic burette, rubber part for alkaline burette) and fill the burette. 
Check if any solution drips from the jet.
### 2. Rinse
First, add distilled water from the top of the burette and let it flow through the jet, repeating several times. 

Then, rinse with titrant in the same manner several times.
### 3. purging a burette 
Purging is necessary before titration:
1. Turn off the valve 
2. Fill the burette to the zero graduation 
3. Open the valve slightly to let titrant drip through the jet
4. Close the valve and refill to zero graduation 

 Air bubbles in the burette tip will cause measurement errors.
