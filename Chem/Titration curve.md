Stage 1: The $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$ remains in solution and the pH increase gently.


Stage 2: The curve isn't vertical but with a very high slope.

After neutralized, the pH become 7 . And more a bit alkaline solutio titrated, the pH leap to around 10+.

Stage 3 : After solution become alkaline, the adding of alkaline solution can increase pH gently due to marginal effect.
