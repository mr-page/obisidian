# Chemical bond
- covalent bond 
- Ionic bond 
- Metallic bond

# Ion
The atom ==tend to attain a stable electronic arrangement== of the nearest noble gas atom by ==gaining or losing outermost shell electrons==.


charge of ion: 3+ â†” 3-
## Cation (+)
- ==All simple ion of metal are cation==
- if metal only one action, the ion has the ==same name as the metal.==
- Transition metal ==can form more than one simple cation== with different charge
## Anion (-)
- All ==Simple ion of non-metal(except H+)== and ==most polyatomic ion== are anion 
- Simple anions have names ending in ==-ide==
- Polyatomic anion ==containing oxygen== often have names ending in ==-ate== or ==-ite==
## Simple ion
Derived from a single atom
==The charge of simple ion refers to the group it is.==
## Polyatomic ion
Derived from a group of atoms


# Metallic Bonding
The metal react with other substance and form ion (+) and free move electron (-).
The free move electron called delocalized electrons. The ion surrounded by delocalized electrons.
The magnetic force between delocalized electron and ion refer to ==electrostatic attraction==(==Metallic bond==)

# Ionic bonding
Cation and anion will attract each other strongly. The electrostatic attraction(ionic bond) hold opposite charge ion.
The ionic bond ==form by transfer of electrons from atom to another==
Only the ==outermost shell electrons involved.==
## Ionic compound
The compound combine by ==ionic bond==.
==Electrically neutral(no charge)==
