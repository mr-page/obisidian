# Chemical bond
- covalent bond 
- Ionic bond 
- Metallic bond
# Ion
The atom ==tend to attain a stable electronic arrangement== of the nearest noble gas atom by ==gaining or losing outermost shell electrons==.

==$\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{4}+}$ ammonium ion : Cation==
$\displaystyle\ce{ Al^{3+} }$ Aluminium ion : Cation

charge of ion: 3+ â†” 3-
## Cation (+)
- ==All simple ion of metal are cation==
- if metal only one action, the ion has the ==same name as the metal.==
- Transition metal ==can form more than one simple cation== with different charge
## Anion (-)
- All ==Simple ion of non-metal(except H+)== and ==most polyatomic ion== are anion 
- Simple anions have names ending in ==-ide==
- Polyatomic anion ==containing oxygen== often have names ending in ==-ate== or ==-ite==
## Simple ion
Derived from a single atom
==The charge of simple ion refers to the group it is.==
## Polyatomic ion
==Derived from a group of atoms==

# Metallic Bonding
The metal react with other substance and form ion (+) and free move electron (-).
The free move electron called delocalized electrons. The ion surrounded by delocalized electrons.
The magnetic force between delocalized electron and ion refer to ==electrostatic attraction==(==Metallic bond==)

# Ionic bonding
Cation and anion will attract each other strongly. The electrostatic attraction(ionic bond) hold opposite charge ion.
The ionic bond ==form by transfer of electrons from atom to another==
Only the ==outermost shell electrons involved.==
## Ionic compound(salt)
The compound combine by ==ionic bond==.
==Electrically neutral(no charge)==
==Cation is named first==,followed by anion. ==The word 'ion' is omitted==





## Formula of ionic compounds 
> [!ABSTRACT]
> 
It shows the types of ions and their simples ratio in the compound  
>The ionic compound is overall electrically 
The formula of the cation is written first , followed by the anion.


# Colours of ions

> [!ABSTRACT]
> 
All main group element form colourless ions in aqueous solution
Transition metals usually form coloured ions in aqueous solution


> [!EXAMPLE]-
$\displaystyle \text{Cr}^{3+}$ Chromium(IIII) ion green\
==$\displaystyle \text{Fe}^{2+}$ Iron(II) ion Light green== \
==$\displaystyle \text{Fe}^{3+}$ Iron(III) ion Yellowish brown==\
$\displaystyle \text{Cu}^{2+}$ Copper(II) ion Bluish green\
$\displaystyle \text{Co}^{2+}$ Cobalt(II) ion Pink\
$\displaystyle \text{Ni}^{2+}$ Nickel(II) ion Green\
==$\displaystyle \text{CrO}^{2-}_{4}$ Chromate ion Yellow==\
==$\displaystyle\text{Cr}_{2}\text{O}_{7}^{2-}$ Dichromate ion Orange==\
$\displaystyle\text{Mn}^{2+}$ Manganese(II) Ion Very pale pink\
==$\displaystyle\text{MnO}^{2-}_{4}$ Permanganate ion Purple==\

# Migration of ions

In the below experiment 
![[Ion migration.excalidraw]]
The ==Purple sport (coloured crystal of potassium of permanganate)== move forward slowly to the positive electrode. 
> [!ABSTRACT]
> This shows ion with charge.

Filter paper must be moisten with sodium sulphate solution to increase its electrical conductivity to speed up the progress of migration
