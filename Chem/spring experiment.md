# Decrease the pressure
absorbant : NaOH 
$\displaystyle\ce{ CO_{2},Cl_{2} H_{2}S , SO_{2}  }$


$\displaystyle\ce{ H_{2}O, HCl }$
$\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{3} }$

$\displaystyle\ce{ NaOH }$
$\displaystyle\ce{ HCl }$

$\displaystyle\ce{ H_{2}O }$
$\displaystyle\ce{ NO_{2},O_{2} }$

The gas dissolve in the solution and decrease the volume of gas 
due to the gas pressure 


# Increase the environmental pressure
