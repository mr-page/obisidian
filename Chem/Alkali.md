#Alkali

> [!NOTE]
> An alkali is a water-soluble base. It dissociates or ionizes to give $\displaystyle\ce{ OH-(aq) }$ as the only anion when dissolved in water
## Strong Alkali
> [!TLDR]
> Complete [[Github/obisidian/Chem/C14#Dissociation|dissociate]]in water

- $\displaystyle\ce{ NaOH }$
- $\displaystyle\ce{ KOH }$
- $\displaystyle\ce{ Ca(OH)2 }$ (slightly soluble)
- $\displaystyle\ce{ Ba(OH)2 }$ ($\displaystyle\ce{ Ba }\text{ is group II element}$)

## Weak Alkali

> [!EXAMPLE]
> 
>- $\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{3} \cdot H_{2}O (\ell)}$ 
## Property of alkali 
> [!NOTE]
> Strong alkali can react with salt to form weaker alkali #questioning
> 
> No reverse reaction
# Descending order of strength of alkali

$\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{3}\cdot H_{2}O > Al(OH)3 > Ca(OH)2 > Fe(OH)2 > Fe(OH)3 > Zn(OH)2 > Si(OH)4}$

Ps: $\displaystyle\ce{ Si(OH)4 }$ also called Orthosilicic acid

Ps: $\displaystyle\ce{ Al(OH)3 }$ is Amphoteric oxide, shows acidity and alkality at the same time.
$\displaystyle\ce{ Al(OH)3 }$ is colloid, something like jelly
can use to neutralize the excess acid in the stomach and relieve pain

In the form of colloid, $\displaystyle\ce{ Al(OH)3 }$ can absorb(吸附)\[attain in the surface of $\displaystyle\ce{ Al(OH)3 }$] the supsension and pigment

## Amphoteric oxide
### react with acid
$\displaystyle\ce{ Al(OH)3 + 3HCl -> AlCl_{3} + 3H_{2}O }$

### react with alkali 
$\displaystyle\ce{ Al(OH_{3}) + NaOH -> Na[Al(OH)4] }$
