# Common acids in the laboratory


[[Acid]]

- hydrochloric acid (HCL)
- sulphuric aicd ($\displaystyle\ce{ H_{2} SO_{4}}$)
- nitric acid ($\displaystyle\ce{ HNO_{3} }$)

# Reaction of acids
> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
$$
\begin{gather}
\text{metal}+\text{acid}\to \text{salt + hydrogen}\\
\text{metal hydroxide + acid} \to\text{salt + water}\\
\text{metal oxide + acid }\to\text{salt + wtaer}
\end{gather}
$$

> [!TIPS]
> ==Copper $\displaystyle\ce{ Cu }$ don't react with acid==



## Collection of Hydrogen ion

The reaction of acid of metal will produce $\displaystyle\ce{ H_{2}}$. It can be collected by water displacement 


Water displacement can't to use for the ==gas that react with water or water soluble gas==
e.g:
- $\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{4}}\text{ Ammonia}$
- $\displaystyle\ce{ CO_{2} }$
- $\displaystyle\ce{ SO_{2} }$
- $\displaystyle\ce{ NO/NO_{2} }$

$$

\begin{gathered}
\ce{ 2H_{2}+O_{2} -> 2H_{2}O }| \text{react with oxygen (combustion)}\\


\end{gathered}
$$

# Role of water

## Ionization
Pure acid is acidic molecule with full non-metal .
It won't react with water
$$
\begin{gathered}
\text{Hydrogen chloride}\\
\ce{ HCl(g)->[H_{2}O(l)] H+(aq) + Cl-(aq) }\\
\text{Hydrogen nitrate}\\
\ce{ NHO_{3}(l)->[H_{2}o(l)] H+(aq) + NO_{3}-(aq) }\\

\end{gathered}
$$
$\displaystyle\ce{ HCl,H_{2}SO_{4},HNO_{3} }$ is called [[Github/obisidian/Chem/C14#Acid|Strong acid]]
Which is inreversible 

The other acid called [[Github/obisidian/Chem/C14#Weak acid|Weak acid]]
Their ionization is reversible
## Autoionization
The water will break down into $\displaystyle\ce{H+ }$ and $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$ ion randomly

---
# Neutralization
$$
\ce{ Acid + Base -> salt + H_{2}O }
$$
The base included :
- Metal oxdie
- Metal Hydroxide
- $\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{4}+}$

## Alkali
The water soluble base called alkali.

> [!EXAMPLE]-
$\displaystyle\ce{ NaOH }$\
$\displaystyle\ce{ POH }$\
$\displaystyle\ce{ Ca(OH)2 }$\
$\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{3} }$

# Alkali
## Ammonina/Ammonium
$$
\begin{gathered}
\ce{ NH_{3}(g) + H_{2}O \rightleftharpoons NH_{4}+ + OH- }\\
\ce{ NH_{4}+ + OH-  ->[heat] NH_{3}(g) + H_{2}O }
\end{gathered}
$$
The ammonium can be test by :
1.  Heated the $\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{4}+ }$ solution which contain water ($\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{3} + H_{2}O \rightleftharpoons NH_{4}+ + OH- }$)
2. Put the moist red litmus paper on the neck of the container 
3. Excepted result: Red litmus paper turns to blue 


# Acid

## Diluted acid
## Concentrated acid

## Strong acid


- Hydrochloric acid : $\displaystyle\ce{ HCl (aq)}$
- SUlphuric acid : $\displaystyle\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4}(aq) }$
- Nitric acid : $\displaystyle\ce{ HNO_{3} (aq)}$

## Weak acid
