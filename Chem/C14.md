# Reaction of acids
> [!EXAMPLE]
> 
$$
\begin{gather}
\text{metal}+\text{acid}\to \text{salt + hydrogen}\\
\text{metal hydroxide + acid} \to\text{salt + water}\\
\text{metal oxide + acid }\to\text{salt + wtaer} 
\end{gather}
$$


>[!EXAMPLE]
>$\displaystyle\ce{ CO_{3}^{2-} + acid -> CO_{2} + H_{2}O }$\
>$\displaystyle\ce{ HCO_{3}- +acid -> salt + CO_{2} + water}$

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
==Heat will be released in the reaction with acid==


> [!TIPS]
> ==Copper $\displaystyle\ce{ Cu }$ don't react with acid==


## Reaction
$\displaystyle\ce{ C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} ->[Conc][H_{2}SO_{4}] 6C + 6H_{2}O  }$


## Collection of Hydrogen gas

The reaction of acid and metal will produce $\displaystyle\ce{ H_{2}}$. It can be collected by ==water displacement ==


Water displacement can't to use for the ==gas that react with water or water soluble gas==
e.g:
- $\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{4}}\text{ Ammonia}$
- $\displaystyle\ce{ CO_{2} }$
- $\displaystyle\ce{ SO_{2} }$
- $\displaystyle\ce{ NO/NO_{2} }$

$$

\begin{gathered}
\ce{ 2H_{2}+O_{2} -> 2H_{2}O }| \text{react with oxygen (combustion)}\\


\end{gathered}

# Role of water

## Ionization
Pure acid is acidic molecule with full non-metal .
It won't react with water
$$
\begin{gathered}
\text{Hydrogen chloride}\\
\ce{ HCl(g)->[H_{2}O(l)] H+(aq) + Cl-(aq) }\\
\text{Hydrogen nitrate}\\
\ce{ NHO_{3}(l)->[H_{2}o(l)] H+(aq) + NO_{3}-(aq) }\\

\end{gathered}
$$
$\displaystyle\ce{ HCl,H_{2}SO_{4},HNO_{3} }$ is called [[Github/obisidian/Chem/C14#Acid|Strong acid]]
Which is inreversible 

The other acid called [[Github/obisidian/Chem/C14#Weak acid|Weak acid]]
Their ionization is reversible



### [[Bascitiy of acid]]
When an acid dissolves in water, its moecules ionize in water to give hydrogen ions. DIfferent acids may give different numbers of hydrogen ions per molecule in their aqueous solutions.
> [!definition]
> 
>Bascity of acid is the number of $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$ which can be produced by the complete ionization of one molecule of the acid

### Ionizable $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$
$\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$ in $\displaystyle\ce{ COOH }$ (carboxylic acid) can be ionized
![[Pasted image 20250322104830.png]]

### Autoionization
The water will break down into $\displaystyle\ce{H+ }$ and $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$ ion randomly

---
# Neutralization
$$
\ce{ Acid + Base -> salt + H_{2}O }
$$
The base included :
- Metal oxdie
- Metal Hydroxide
- $\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{4}+}$
>[!Obersvation]
>Heat will be released

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ACID AND BASE \
> AT LEAST ONE OF AQUEOUS STATE


## Alkali
The water soluble base called alkali.

> [!EXAMPLE]-
$\displaystyle\ce{ NaOH }$\
$\displaystyle\ce{ POH }$\
$\displaystyle\ce{ Ca(OH)2 }$\
$\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{3} }$

# Alkali


## Strong Alkali
> [!TLDR]
> Complete ionizable in water

- $\displaystyle\ce{ NaOH }$
- $\displaystyle\ce{ KOH }$
- $\displaystyle\ce{ Ca(OH)2 }$ (slightly soluble)
- $\displaystyle\ce{ Ba(OH)2 }$

## Weak Alkali
- $\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{3} \cdot H_{2}O (l)}$ 
- 

## Alkali reaction

1. $\displaystyle\ce{ alkali + carbon dioxide -> metal carbonate + water }$
2. $\displaystyle\ce{ alkali (aq)+ salt_{1}(aq) -> metal hydroxide(s) + salt_{2}(aq) }$
   $\displaystyle\ce{Mg^{2+}(aq) + 2OH-(aq) ->Mg(OH)2(s) }$
3. 
## Ammonina/Ammonium
$$
\begin{gathered}
\ce{ NH_{3}(g) + H_{2}O \rightleftharpoons NH_{4}+ + OH- }\\
\ce{ NH_{4}+ + OH-  ->[heat] NH_{3}(g) + H_{2}O }
\end{gathered}
$$
The ammonium can be test by :
1.  Heated the $\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{4}+ }$ solution which contain water ($\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{3} + H_{2}O \rightleftharpoons NH_{4}+ + OH- }$)
2. Put the moist red litmus paper on the neck of the container 
3. Excepted result: Red litmus paper turns to blue 

### Ammonia/Ammonium Reaction
$\displaystyle\ce{ ammonium compound + alkali ->[heat] salt + ammonia + water }$


For example 
$\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{4}Cl(zq) + NaOH(aq) ->[heat] NaCl(aq) + NH_{3}(g) +{ H_{2}O(l)} }$

Ionic equation:
$\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{4}+(aq) + OH-(aq) ->[heat] NH_{3}(g) + H_{2}O(l) }$

# Acid

## Pure acid
100% acid without $\displaystyle\ce{ H2O ,H+}$
Pure $\displaystyle\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} (l)}$ : colourless oily solution 



## Concentrated acid

## Diluted acid

## Strong acid
- Highly corrosive

> [!EXAMPLE]
> - Hydrochloric acid : $\displaystyle\ce{ HCl (aq)}$
>- SUlphuric acid : $\displaystyle\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4}(aq) }$
>- Nitric acid : $\displaystyle\ce{ HNO_{3} (aq)}$
