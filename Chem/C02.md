# Matter
## Pure Substance
Element is a pure substance that cannot be down into simpler substance by==chemical== methods 
## Mixtures(Physical)
Mixture conunds(Chemical)
A compoundsist of two or more pure substance which have not ==chemically combined together== 
## Compo is a pure substance made up of two more element ==chemically combined together==

# ==Fractional distillation of liquid air==

used to separate oxygen nitrogen and other 

## Purification 
Filtered to remove dust particle  and cooled to remove Carbon dioxide and water vapour from filtered air

## Liquefaction 
The Purified air is then cooled and compressed . Repeated several times.

## Fractional distillation

The liquid is passed into the bottom of a fractionating column.
Different gases in the air boil at different temperature 


# Use of oxygen and nitrogen
#Oxygen #Nitrogen 
- For breathing  by divers and firefighters
- For cutting and welding metals 
- As a refrigerant
