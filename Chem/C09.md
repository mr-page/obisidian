# Structures of substances
- Giant metallic structure 
- Giant ionic structure
- Simple molecular structure 
- Giant covalent structure

#  Giant metallic structure (solid)
The metallic bond is the attraction force between sea of delocalized ion and metal ion
![[GIant_metallic_structure.excalidraw]]
## Conduct electricity 
The ==present of delocalized electron(-)s== let the giant metallic structure be conduct electricity ==in solid and molten state==
## Hard and strong , high melting point
- The metallic bond between metal ions and sea of delocalized electrons is strong 
- Closed package
## High density
The metal ions in a giant metallic structure pack closely together.
## Malleable and ductile
When a force act on a piece of metal, 
because the metallic bond between delocalized electron and metal ion,==the layers of metal ions can slide over one another.==
> [!HINT]
> The ==non-directional metallic bonds== still hold the metal ions together,

# Giant ionic structure 
Ionic bond is the attraction force between the positive ion and negative ion.
e.g. as the $\displaystyle\ce{ NaCl }$ 
> [!EXAMPLE]- $\displaystyle\ce{ NaCl }$
> 
![[NaCl_complex_structure.excalidraw]]
![[NaCl_simple_structure.excalidraw]]
The $\displaystyle\ce{ Na+ }$ ion and $\displaystyle\ce{ Cl+}$ ion are hold by ionic bond together.
Pack regularly so that ==each ion is surrounded== by six ions of the opposite charge.
Form a cubic structure
> [!IMPORTANT]
> ==Contains equal numbers== of $\displaystyle\ce{Na+}$ ion and $\displaystyle\ce{Cl-}$  ion 

The ratio of $\displaystyle\ce{ NaCl }$ is 6:6

e.g of $\displaystyle\ce{ CsCl }$
![[CsCl_simple_strcuture.excalidraw]]
# Conduct electricity in molten state or in aqueous solution
==The ion are not mobile in the solid state==
When compounds in the molten or aqueous state. The ion are mobile and conduct electricity

## High melting point and boiling point 
==A lot of energy is required to break the strong ionic bonds== between ion during melting and boiling.

## Hard and brittle 
The strong Ionic bonds make the compounds hard.
Under great force, ==the relative movement of the ions== bring ions of the same charge close to each other, ==result in repulsion== and the crystal will break

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The melting point depend on the molecule size which ==larger size==
> 
>==higher the melting point==



> [!EXAMPLE] Repulsion
> the relative movement of the ions result in repulsion

## Solubility 
==Many ionic compounds solve in water , all of them not solve in organic solvents==

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
==The new attraction between the (solvent) molecule and (solute) molecule (not) strong enough to overcome the the attraction forces between (solvent) molecule and the attraction forces between (solute) molecule.==

# Simple molecule structure
The force connect the simple molecule are named 
==Van der Waals' forces== which is much weaker than the covalent bond , ionic bond , metallic bond.

## Non-conductors 
Absent of delocalized electrons

# Electrolytes
==Some== simple molecule structure substance dissolve in water , mobile ion form and conduct electricity.

## Brittle, Low melting and boiling point

Weak Van Der Waals' forces .

# Giant covalent structures
> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
Only ==Group IV element(C, SI)== can form the giant covalent structures

## Diamond
3-dimensinoal ==infinite network of atoms==
- not conduct electricity
- Many Strong covalent between carbon atoms
## Graphite
Covalent bond between carbon atoms within layers
- Van der Waals' forces between layers of carbon atoms
- ==Conduct electricity inside the layers==



# Atom,molecule

## Atomicity 
The total number of atom in a molecule

## Relative molecular mass 
 $$
\begin{gathered}
\text{ Relative molecular mass of an element or a compound } =\\
\text{Sum of the relative atomic masses of all atoms present
 }\\
 \text{ in a molecule of the element or compound}
\end{gathered}
