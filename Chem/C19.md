# Titration 
A volumetric analysis technique used to determine the concentration of a sample solution. 
This tecnnique requires the use of a standard solution which is a solution of accurately known concentration.

> [!definition] Standard solution
>  is a solution of accurately known solution

## Titrate
Add about 20mL of titrated solution to a conical flask.

Titration rate should decrease from fast to slow until drop-by-drop.

Add solution till the colour of solution change sharply [^1], the range of colour change more close to 7. Less error.

# Back titration (回滴) 
Some reaction has react over one times 

e.g. $\displaystyle\ce{ Na_{2}CO_{3} + HCl -> NaHCO_{3} + NaCl }$ 

$\displaystyle\ce{ NaHCO_{3} + HCl -> NaCl + CO_{2} + H_{2}O }$

To ensure the reaction in titration has complete, excess titrant will be added. 

To achieve the neutral, back titration were required.

[^1]: The range of colour change of pH indicator would affect the error, for methyl orange and phenolphthalein , their range do not cover the 7. By the experiment result, when the colour of them changed, the solution ==ALMOST== neutralized.
