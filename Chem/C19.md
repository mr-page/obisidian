# Titration 
A volumetric analysis technique used to determine the concentration of a sample solution. 
This tecnnique requires the use of a standard solution which is a solution of accurately known concentration.

> [!definition] Standard solution
>  is a solution of accurately known solution




## Acid-alkaline titration
Titration to find the solution required to neutral the solution which known for the component. 


## Burette

> [!IMPORTANT] Reason why use burette
> Test tube are low capacity and have no scale to measure the solution dropped, therefore use burette instead of test tube



The burette hold by stand and burette clamp

### Acidity Burette

There is a valve to control the flowing of solution
It can be used to contain the ==oxidizing and acidic== solution
### Alkaline Burette

Apart of alkaline burette is made by rubber which containing a glass ball to control the flowing of solution by extrude.
It can be used to contain the ==reducibility and alkaline== solution
## Fill a burette #Questioning
It is necessary to exhaust before using the titration tube. #Questioning

If there's the air in the endpoint of burette, the measurement will be higher than exact value.
## Cleaning of burette
Firstly , adding the distilled water from the top of burette and let the jet (噴嘴), repeat for serveral times. Then, use sample solution in the same way repeat for serveral times.
