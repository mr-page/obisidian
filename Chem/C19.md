# Preparation of standard solution
Procedure:
1. Dissolve the solid salt in about 100 $\displaystyle cm^{3}$ of distilled water in a beaker. Stir the solution with a glass rod
2. Pour the solution into a ==250.0 $\displaystyle cm^{3}$ volumetric flask through a filter funnel by glass rod[^2]== 
3. ==Wash the beaker and glass rod== with distilled water serveral times. ==Pour all the washing into the volumetric flask[^3]==
4. Add distilled water to volumetric flask until full
5. Stopper the flask and invert it serveral times to mix the contents well
# Titration 
A volumetric analysis technique used to determine the concentration of a sample solution. 
This tecnnique requires the use of a standard solution which is a solution of accurately known concentration.

# Back titration (回滴) 
Some reaction has react over one times 

e.g. $\displaystyle\ce{ Na_{2}CO_{3} + HCl -> NaHCO_{3} + NaCl }$ 

$\displaystyle\ce{ NaHCO_{3} + HCl -> NaCl + CO_{2} + H_{2}O }$

To ensure the reaction in titration has complete, excess titrant will be added. 

To achieve the neutral, back titration were required.

[^1]: The range of colour change of pH indicator would affect the error, for methyl orange and phenolphthalein , their range do not cover the 7. By the experiment result, when the colour of them changed, the solution ==ALMOST== neutralized.

[^2]: Guide the solution into filter funnel

[^3]: Ensure all the solution washed and pour into volumetric flask to ensure the molarity of solution unchanged
