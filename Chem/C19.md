# Apparatus 
![[Apparatus]]
![[Acid-alkaline titration#Acidity Burette]]


# Preparation of standard solution
## By primary substance
Procedure:
1. Dissolve the solid salt in about 100 $\displaystyle cm^{3}$ of distilled water in a beaker. Stir the solution with a glass rod
2. Pour the solution into a ==250.0 $\displaystyle cm^{3}$ volumetric flask through a filter funnel by glass rod[^2]== 
3. ==Wash the beaker and glass rod== with distilled water serveral times. ==Pour all the washing into the volumetric flask[^3]==
4. Add distilled water to volumetric flask until full
5. Stopper the flask and invert it serveral times to mix the contents well

## By diluting a known concentration solution 
1. Use a pipeete to transfer 25.0$\displaystyle cm^{3}$ of the original solution to a 250.0 $\displaystyle cm^{3}$ volumetric flask
2. Add distilled water to volumetric flask till the graduation mark
3. ==Stopper the flask and invert it serveral times to mix the contents well.==

# Acid-alkline titration 
A volumetric analysis technique used to determine the concentration of a sample solution. 
This tecnnique requires the use of a standard solution which is a solution of accurately known concentration.

# Equivalence point and end point 
> [!definition] Equivalence point

> ==Almost the neutral==

## Indicator
![[Acid-base indicator for titration]]

# Back titration (回滴) 
For some water-insoluble substance, it can't dissolve in water directly to form solution. So dissolve them in excess acid, and titrate unreacted acid by alkali to find the amount of acid reacted and water-insoluble substance

> [!TLDR]
> 1. Calculate the amount of acid added at the start
> 2. Calculate the amount of ==excess acid== from the back titration results
> 3. Calculate the amount of acid reacted with the substance in the sample 
> 4. Calculate the amount of the substance in the sample
> 
> $\displaystyle\text{Amount of acid added at the start} -\text{Amount of excess acid from the titration results}$
> $\displaystyle =\text{ Amount of acid reacted with the substance in the sample}$





e.g. $\displaystyle\ce{ Na_{2}CO_{3} + HCl -> NaHCO_{3} + NaCl }$ 

$\displaystyle\ce{ HCl + NaOH -> NaCl + H_{2}O }$

> [!EXAMPLE]-  NH4NO3 react with HCl
> $\displaystyle\ce{ HCl + NaOH -> NaCl + H_{2}O }$
> 
> Mole ratio of HCl : NaOH = 1:1
> 
> No of mole of $\displaystyle\ce{ HCl }$ in $\displaystyle 25cm^{3}$ = $\frac{\displaystyle\text{Volume}}{1000}\times\text{Molarity}$
> 
> No of mole of $\displaystyle\ce{ HCl }$ reacts with ammonia =  Total Volume - $\frac{\displaystyle\text{Volume}}{1000}\times\text{Molarity}$
> 
> $\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{3} + HCl -> NH_{4}CL }$
> 
> $\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{4}NO_{3} + KOH -> KNO_{3} + NH_{3} + H_{2}O }$
> 
> The mole ratio of $\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{4}NO_{3} : HCl}$  = 1 : 1
> 
> Percentage by mass of $\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{4}NO_{3} }$ = 80$\displaystyle \times \frac{\text{Total Volume} - \frac{\displaystyle\text{Volume}}{1000}\times\text{Molarity}}{\text{Mass}} \times 100\%$

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This experiment ==assume only the substance measuing in the sample reacts with alkali==

# Lab report #WIP

[^1]: The range of colour change of pH indicator would affect the error, for methyl orange and phenolphthalein , their range do not cover the 7. By the experiment result, when the colour of them changed, the solution ==ALMOST== neutralized.
[^2]: Guide the solution into filter funnel

[^3]: Ensure all the solution washed and pour into volumetric flask to ensure the molarity of solution unchanged
