# Titration 
A volumetric analysis technique used to determine the concentration of a sample solution. 
This tecnnique requires the use of a standard solution which is a solution of accurately known concentration.

> [!definition] Standard solution
>  is a solution of accurately known solution




## Acid and alkaline titration
Titration to find the solution required to neutral the solution which known for the component. 


## Burette

> [!IMPORTANT] Reason why use burette
> Test tube are low capacity and have no scale to measure the solution dropped, therefore use burette instead of test tube



The burette hold by burette stand

### Acidity Burette
There is a valve to control the flowing of solution

### Alkaline Burette 
Apart of alkaline burette is made by rubber which containing a glass ball to control the flowing of solution by extrude.
