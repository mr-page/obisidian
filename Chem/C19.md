# Titration 
A volumetric analysis technique used to determine the concentration of a sample solution. 
This tecnnique requires the use of a standard solution which is a solution of accurately known concentration.

> [!definition] Standard solution
>  is a solution of accurately known solution




## Acid-alkaline titration
Titration to find the solution required to neutral the solution which known for the component. 


## Burette

> [!IMPORTANT] Reason why use burette
> Test tube are low capacity and have no scale to measure the solution dropped, therefore use burette instead of test tube



The burette hold by stand and burette clamp

### Acidity Burette
![[Pasted image 20250412205020.png]]

There is a valve to control the flowing of solution
It can be used to contain the ==[[Oxidizing|oxidizing]] and acidic== solution
### Alkaline Burette

Apart of alkaline burette is made by rubber which containing a glass ball to control the flowing of solution by extrude.
It can be used to contain the ==[[Reducibility|reducibility]]reducibility and alkaline== solution
## purging a burette 
Purging a burette is neccessary before titration to . 
Firstly, turn off the valve. 
Then, fill the burette till the zero graduation.
After that, turn on the valve slightly let the titrant drip through the jet.
Close the valve after this and refill the burette till zero graduation.


If there's the air in the endpoint of burette, the measurement will be higher than exact value.
## Rinse
Firstly , adding the distilled water from the top of burette and let the jet (噴嘴), repeat for serveral times. Then, use titrant in the same way repeat for serveral times.

## The deviation due to change of concentration of titrant #WIP


# Back titration (回滴) 
Some reaction has react over one times 

e.g. $\displaystyle\ce{ Na_{2}CO_{3} + HCl -> NaHCO_{3} + NaCl }$ 

$\displaystyle\ce{ NaHCO_{3} + HCl -> NaCl + CO_{2} + H_{2}O }$

To ensure the reaction in titration has complete, excess titrant will be added. 

To achieve the neutral, back titration were required.
