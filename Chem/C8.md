# Covalent bonding and covalent compounds

> [!INFO]
A covalent bond forms by the ==sharing== of outermost shell electrons between ==two atoms==
![[Covalent between H and H atom .excalidraw]]

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Covalent bond refers to the electrostatic attraction between the shared electrons and the two nuclei of the bonded atoms

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A shared pair(bond pair/ bond pair of electrons) of electrons make a single covalent bond
![[Covalent between Cl and Cl atom .excalidraw]]
The electron not participate in sharing of atom

## Multiple covalent bonds

Double covalent bond

![[Covalent between O and O atom .excalidraw]]
triple covalent bond
![[Covalent between N and N atom .excalidraw]]

> [!HINT]
> Reaction need break bond , triple covalent bond is much harder to break compared with single and double covalent bond . Therefore, $\displaystyle N_{2}$ is unreactive since it has triple covalent bond 

# Dative covalent bond 配價鍵
dative covalent bond is a covalent bond formed between two atoms ==where both electrons in the shared pair are contributed by the same atom.==

$\displaystyle\pu{ \text{Ammonia }NH3+\text{Hydrogen ion }H^{-}\to \text{Ammonium ion }NH_{4}^{-}}$
![[Ammonium ion.excalidraw]]
![[Dative bond e.g.excalidraw]]

(except $\displaystyle\ce{ OH+ }$)


# Relative molecular mass and formula mass

Relative molecular mass (molecular mass) of an element or a compound is given by the sum of the relative atomic masses of all atoms present in a molecule of that element or compound have no unit

> [!SUMMARY]
>Relative molecular mass = sum of the relative atomic masses of all atoms present in a molecule of the element or compound



Formula mass is used to describe the ionic compounds since they are not the molecule, having no unit same as Relative molecular mass
> [!SUMMARY] 
> Formula mass = sum of the relative atomic masses [[obsidian/Chem/C5|C5]] of all atoms present in one ==formula unit== of the substance(or species)

# Chemical bonding summation 

## Metallic bonding 

- ==Having the sea of delocalized electron==
-  electrostatic attraction between negatively charged delocalized electrons and positively charged metal ions
- ==conduct electricity==
- between metal
## Ionic bonding
- ==Absent of sea of delocalized electron==
- Electrostatic attraction holding the ==oppositely charged ion==s together
- Only conduct electricity in ==molten /aqueous (aq) state==
- between metal and non-metal
## Covalent bonding
- ==Electrostatic attraction between the shared electrons and the two nuclei of the bonded atoms==
- between non-metal
