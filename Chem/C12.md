# Mole 
Mole is the amount of a substance that contains the same number of formula units as the number of atoms in exactly 12.0g of carbon-12 
$$
\text{number of moles of substance A}(mol)= \frac{\text{number of substance A}}{\text{Avogradro constant}(mol^{-1})}
$$
$$
\text{Avogradro constant}= 6.02\times 10^{23}
$$

## Molar mass
> [!definition]
> The mass of one mole of a substance called its molar mass $\displaystyle(g\ mol^{-1})$

# Percentage by mass of element A in a compound 
Percentage by mass of element A in a compound =
$$\frac{\displaystyle\text{relative atomic mass of A }\times\text{ number of atoms of A in the formula}}{\text{formula mass of the compound}}100\%$$
# Empricial formula 
The simplest Whole number rating of the atoms or ions present in the compound
