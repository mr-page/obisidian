# Mole 
Mole is the amount of a substance that contains the same number of formula units as the number of atoms in exactly 12.0g of carbon-12 
$$
\text{number of moles of substance A} = \frac{\text{number of substance A}}{\text{Avogradro constant}(mol^{-1})}
$$
$$
\text{Avogradro constant}= 6.02\times 10^{23}
$$

## Molar mass
> [!definition]
> The mass of one mole of a substance called its molar mass $\displaystyle(g\ mol^{-1})$
