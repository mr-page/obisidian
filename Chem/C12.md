# Mole 
A mole is the amount of a substance that contains the same number of formula units as the number of atoms in exactly 12.0g of carbon-12 
$$
\text{number of moles of substance A(mol)} = \frac{\text{mass of substance A(g)}}{\text{Molar mass of A} (g mol^{-1} )}
$$
$$
\text{number of moles of substance A}(mol)= \frac{\text{Number of particles of substance A}}{\text{Avogadro constant}(mol^{-1})}
$$
$$
\text{Avogradro constant}= 6.02\times 10^{23} \text{ mol}^{-1}
$$

## Molar mass (M)

> [!definition]
> The mass of one mole of a substance is called its molar mass $\displaystyle(g\ mol^{-1})$

# Percentage by mass of element A in a compound 
Percentage by mass of element A in a compound =
$$\frac{\displaystyle\text{relative atomic mass of A }\times\text{ number of atoms of A in the formula}}{\text{formula mass of the compound}}\times100\%$$
# Empricial formula 
The simplest whole number ratio of the atoms or ions present in the compound

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The ratio of masses of different components should be rounded to the nearest integer.
# Yield
## Theoretical yield
Calculated from the chemical equation

## Actual yield
From reaction

## Percentage yield
$\frac{\displaystyle \text{Actual yield}}{\text{Theoratical yeild}}\times100\%$
**Note:**Â Assumes 100% complete reaction.

### Reason
- Impurities in reactants.  
- Side products or side reactions.  
- Loss of product during experimental procedures.  
- Incomplete reaction.
