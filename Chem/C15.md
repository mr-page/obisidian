# Molarity (C)
> [!definition] Unit Convertion
> $C(M) = mol/L$
The unit of molarity is M

# pH 

> [!definition] Unit convertion
> $pH = -\log(\ce{ H+ }(Molarity))$

# Avogardro constant (NA)
1 mol of substance's, its particle number is $\displaystyle 6.02\times 10^{23}$ , the avogadro constant 


# Mass (m)
The total mass of a substance

# [[Github/obisidian/Chem/C12#C15 Molar mass (M)|Molar mass(M)]]


# Mole number of substance(n)

for solid state

$$
n =\frac{m}{M} = \frac{N}{NA}
$$

for gas , under STP
$$
n = \frac{V(\text{Volume of the gaseous substance})}{V_{m}}
$$
$$
V_{m} = 22.4L
$$
