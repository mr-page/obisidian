# Molarity/Molar concentraction (C)
> [!definition] Unit Convertion
> $C(M) = mol/L$
The unit of molarity is M

$$
C = \frac{\text{No of moles }(mol)}{\text{Volume }(dm^{3})}
$$


> [!EXAMPLE]- If the substance is aqueous state
> $$
C = \frac{\text{No of moles of solute (mol)}}{\text{Volume of solution }(dm^{3})}
$$
# pH 

> [!definition] Unit convertion
> $pH = -\log(\ce{ H+ }(Molarity))$

# Avogardro constant (NA)
1 mol of substance's, its particle number is $\displaystyle 6.02\times 10^{23}$ , the avogadro constant 


# Mass (m)
The total mass of a substance

# [[Github/obisidian/Chem/C12#C15 Molar mass (M)|Molar mass(M)]]

# Density ($\displaystyle gcm^{-3}$) ($\displaystyle \rho$) 

$$
 \rho = \frac{m}{v} = \frac{\text{mass of solution (g)}}{\text{Volume of solution }(cm^{3})}
$$

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ==Mind the unit of density and concentration== 
> Molarity use the unit of $\displaystyle M$ 
> Concentration of solution is $\displaystyle gdm^{-3}$
> density is $\displaystyle gcm^{-3}$
# Mole number of substance(n)

for solid state
 
$$
n =\frac{m}{M} = \frac{N}{NA} = C \cdot V(\text{Volume})
$$

for gas , under STP
$$
n = \frac{V(\text{Volume of the gaseous substance})}{V_{m}}
$$
$$
V_{m} = 24L (\text{The volume of one mole particle in gaseous state})
$$




# Variant formula 
$$
\omega = \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{mass of solution}}
$$

For given density  of solution and density percentage of solute 
$$
C = \frac{1000\cdot \rho \cdot \omega}{M}
$$
