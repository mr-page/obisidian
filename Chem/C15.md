# Molarity/Molar concentraction (C)
> [!definition] Unit Convertion
> $C(M) = mol/L$
The unit of molarity is M

$$
C = \frac{\text{mass of solute }}{\text{Volume}}
$$
# pH 

> [!definition] Unit convertion
> $pH = -\log(\ce{ H+ }(Molarity))$

# Avogardro constant (NA)
1 mol of substance's, its particle number is $\displaystyle 6.02\times 10^{23}$ , the avogadro constant 


# Mass (m)
The total mass of a substance

# [[Github/obisidian/Chem/C12#C15 Molar mass (M)|Molar mass(M)]]

# Density ($\displaystyle gcm^{-3}$)

$$
\frac{\text{mass of solution (g)}}{\text{Volume of solution }(cm^{3})}
$$


# Mole number of substance(n)

for solid state
 
$$
n =\frac{m}{M} = \frac{N}{NA} = C \cdot V
$$

for gas , under STP
$$
n = \frac{V(\text{Volume of the gaseous substance})}{V_{m}}
$$
$$
V_{m} = 24L (\text{The volume of one mole particle in gaseous state})
$$
