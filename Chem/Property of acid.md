# Property of acid

## Pure acid
100% acid without $\displaystyle\ce{H2O}$ or $\displaystyle\ce{H+}$

Pure $\displaystyle\ce{H2SO4(l)}$: colourless oily solution 

## Strong acid

### Concentrated $\displaystyle\ce{HCl}$
- Contains 35% hydrogen chloride
- Colourless volatile liquid

### Concentrated $\displaystyle\ce{HNO3}$
- Colourless volatile liquid
- Often turns yellow during storage
- Stored in brown bottles

### Concentrated $\displaystyle\ce{H2SO4}$
- 98% sulphuric acid
- Colourless oily liquid
- Strong dehydrating agent
- Powerful oxidizing agent

#### Dehydrating and Hygroscopic
