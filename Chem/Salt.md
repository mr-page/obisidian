## Action 


### Example: Preparation of $\displaystyle\ce{ MgSO_{4} }$
#### 1. To produce the $\displaystyle\ce{ MgSO_{4}(aq) }$
$$
\begin{gathered}
\text{Reaction of magnesium metal with dilute sulphuric acid}\\
\ce{ Mg(s) + H_{2}SO_{4}(aq) -> MgSO_{4}(aq) + H_{2}(g) }\\
\\
\text{Reaction of magnesium oxide with dilute sulphuric acid}\\
\ce{ MgO(s) }\\
\\
\text{Reaction of magnesium carbonate with dilute sulphuric acid}\\
\ce{ MgCO_{3}(s) + H_{2}SO_{4}  -> MgSO_{4}(aq) + Co_{2}(g) + H_{2}O(\l))}
\end{gathered}
$$

#### 2. Increase the concentration of $\displaystyle\ce{ MgSO_{4}(aq) }$
   Heat the solution to increase the concentration to saturated state and let the solution warm up

#### 3.Crystalization 
leave the saturated solution aside to cool slowly to room temperature.
#### 4.Filtration 
Filter the residual solution to obtains the crystals 

#### 5.Washing 
Wash the crystals with ==a little cold distilled water==

#### 6. Drying 
Dry with fitler paper 

#### 7. Remove the impurity by magnet(Out of school  but within dse syllabus)
Put the magnet nearby the crystal to attract the impurities(e.g. pure iron) 

### Purification of $\displaystyle\ce{ MgSO_{4} }$ 
The progress of purification is ideal and theoretical, no 100% purification in real experiment.
