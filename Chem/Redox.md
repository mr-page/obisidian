concentrated sulphuric acid
$\displaystyle\ce{ Cu + 2H_{2}SO_{4} ->[heat] CuSO_{4} + 2H_{2}O + SO_{2} }$

$\displaystyle\ce{ SO_{4}^{2-} }$ is more oxidizing than $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$ in concentrated condition

Oxidation : 
decrease of charge


Reduction : 
Rise of charge

Oxidation occurs with reduction


$\displaystyle\ce{ S : -2,0,4,6 }$
$\displaystyle\ce{  }$

# Oxidation agent
Which valence decreased after reaction

# Reduction agent
Which valence increased after reaction
