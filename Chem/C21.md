# Homologous series and functional groups

> [!definition]
> A homologous series is a seris of carbon compounds that have the same general formula and each members ==differs from the next by $\displaystyle\ce{ -CH_{2}- {Unit} }$==

Members of a homoglous series are found to ==have similar chemical properties.==
And ==different physical properties==

For the number of carbons increase, the :
- ==volatility decrease and viscosity increase==
- ==Melting point increase ==
- ==More sooty flame released== when combustion (Hard to complete combustion)

# Naming Rules

Name rules ==used the IUPAC system==

## Alkane

All alkanes have systematic names ==ending with the suffix -ane.==


#### Naming straight-chain alkanes
> [!CAUTION]
> FIND THE ==LONGEST CARBON CHAIN== AS MAIN BODY

| Number of carbon | Systematic name |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| 1                | meth(ane)       |
| 2                | eth(ane)        |
| 3                | prop(ane)       |
| 4                | but(ane)        |
| 5                | pent(ane)       |
| 6                | hex(ane)        |
| 7                | hept(ane)       |
| 8                | oct(ane)        |
| 9                | non(ane)        |
| 10               | dec(ane)        |
#### Naming branched-chain alkanes

Two parts consisted :
1. The prefix which indicate the ==alkyl group substituents==
2. The root which indicated the ==main carbon chain==

Prefixes + Root

##### Name of alkyl group

| Number of carbon | Alkyl group |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| 1                | methyl      |
| 2                | ethyl       |
| 3                | propyl      |
| 4                | butyl       |
| 5                | pentyl      |
| 6                | hexyl       |
| 7                | heptyl      |
| 8                | octyl       |
3. For the ==structure have ambiguity== , present the the position of substituents which the summation of number of substituents s==hould be the least without violate higher priority rules==,presnt it front of the substituent.
   e.g.
   $\displaystyle\ce{ 2-{butanoic acid} }$
4. If two or more of the same alkyl group are attached to main carbon chain, group them together and name with multiplying prefix

| Number of the same substituent | multiplying prefix |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| 2                              | di-                |
| 3                              | tri-               |
| 4                              | tetra-             |
| 5                              | penta-             |
e.g.
$\displaystyle\ce{ 2,3-{dimethylpetane} }$
5. Arrange the different alkyl ==in alphabetical order== of ==the first letter in the name of alkyl groups==
   e.g.
   3-ethyl-2,4-dimethylhexane


## Alkene

Use suffix -ene

To prevent the ambiguity, a number will be added in front of suffix -ene which the ==must smallest number possible numeral==  which indicate the the position of functional group

e.g.
4-methylhex-2-ene

For more than one functional group

The indicated number should be the least summation of possible numberal.
And there will  be an 'a' after the main chain

e.g.
4-methyl==hexa==-2,4-diene

## Name of haloalkanes
> [!definition]
> Haloalknes are alkanes with halogen substituents 

#WIP 

## Alkanols
#WIP 
## Alkanoic acid

#WIP 
## Complex Hydrocarbon
The naming rules of substitument is also suitable for functional group

e.g. propane-1,2,3-triol


For alkanoic acid, no need numeral for functional group for no ambiguity 

e.g. hexanedioic acid
#WIP 


### Priority of functional group 

$\displaystyle\ce{ C-H < R-X\text{ (Halogen)} < C#C < C=C < C-OH < COOH}$

## Cycloalkanes
