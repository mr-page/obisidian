# Energy change in chemical reaction  
Any reaction included the energy change although the temperature might not change 
break bond and form bond lead to absorb and release heat 

## Exothermic nature of neutralization

The heat given out from the neutralization between any strong acid and any strong alkaline is almost constant($\displaystyle\ce{ 57.3kJ mol^{-1} }\text{ for one mole }\ce{ H+ }\text{ and }\ce{ OH- }$)  
$$
\ce{ H+(aq) + OH-(aq) -> H_{2}O(\ell) }
$$

if the mole ratio of $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$ and $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$ is 1:1, for per mol of $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$ and $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$, $\displaystyle\ce{ 57.3kJ }$ heat released.

From alternative side, if the mole number of $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$ and $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$ are different, the number take the lesser one.

Don't pick too diluted or concentrated solution in experiment 

Be quick to prevent heat loss


### Measurement of heat release
Measure the time of solution for few minute to ==ensure the solution at same initial temperature.==

The container should be poor heat container(e.g. Expanded polystyrene cup)

Use the same thermometer

THe bulb of termometer completely immerse in the solution and don't touch the wall or bottom of container 

> [!NOTE]
> The amount of energy released by weak acid/alkaline will be lesser since apart of them used to complete ionization in water.
