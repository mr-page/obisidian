# Energy change in chemical reaction  
Any reaction included the energy change although the temperature might not change 
break bond and form bond lead to absorb and release heat 

## Exothermic nature of neutralization

The heat given out from the neutralization between any strong acid and any strong alkaline is almost constant($\displaystyle\ce{ 57.3kJ mol^{-1} }\text{ for one mole }\ce{ H+ }\text{ and }\ce{ OH- }$)  
$$
\ce{ H+(aq) + OH-(aq) -> H_{2}O(\ell) }
$$

if the mole ratio of $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$ and $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$ is 1:1, for per mol of $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$ and $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$, $\displaystyle\ce{ 57.3kJ }$ heat released.

From alternative side, if the mole number of $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$ and $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$ are different, the number take the lesser one.

Don't pick too diluted or concentrated solution in experiment 

Be quick to prevent heat loss


### Measurement of heat release
Measure the time of solution for few minute to ==ensure the solution at same initial temperature.==

The container should be poor heat container(e.g. Expanded polystyrene cup)

Use the same thermometer

THe bulb of termometer completely immerse in the solution and don't touch the wall or bottom of container 

> [!NOTE]
> The amount of energy released by weak acid/alkaline will be lesser since apart of them used to complete ionization in water.
## Usage of neutralization
### Adjust pH of soil
#### acidic environment
Use $\displaystyle\ce{ Ca(OH)2 }$ as best 
$\displaystyle\ce{ CaO }$ is also ok but required to frequency water the soil
Both of them are slightly soluble in water and retain in soil for longer time

$\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{3} }$ can't be used since it is ==volatile, toxic and given out pungent smell after volatile==

$\displaystyle\ce{ NaOH, KOH }$ is corrosive and harmful to the soil
#### Alkaline environment
$\displaystyle\ce{ (NH_{4})2SO_{4} }$  slightly soluble
$\displaystyle\ce{ (NH_{4})2SO_{4} + 2OH- -> 2NH_{3} + 2H_{2}O}$


### Neutralizing excess acid in stomach
Antacid used to heal stomachache

It concluded ==$\displaystyle\ce{ Mg(OH)2 }$ and $\displaystyle\ce{ Al(OH)3 }$== both are insoluble in water and milder reaction in neutralization.

==The akaline component with $\displaystyle\ce{ CO_{3}^{2-} }$  like $\displaystyle\ce{ MgCO_{3} }$ should not be used==
$\displaystyle\ce{ MgCO_{3} + 2HCl -> MgCl_{2} + CO_{2} + H_{2}O}$


The generated Carbon dioxide will ==bloated stomach lead to unconfortable==

==$\displaystyle\ce{ NaOH , KOH}$ should not be used since it is corrosive.==

> [!NOTE]
> THe antacid should be ==in form of powder for larger surface area and quicker neutralization==


### Treating industrial liquid waste
As fast as possible
$\displaystyle\ce{ NaOH, NaCO_{3} , H_{2}SO_{4}}$ would be used since they are water soluble

### Making fertilizers
$\displaystyle\ce{ NH_{4}NO_{3}(aq) }$: $\displaystyle\ce{ NHO_{3}(aq) + NH_{3}(aq) -> NH_{4}NO_{3} }$

$\displaystyle\ce{ (NH_{4})2SO_{4}(aq) }$ : $\displaystyle\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4}(aq) + 2NH_{3}(aq) -> (NH_{4})2SO_{4}(aq) }$

They are ==very soluble in wtaer and easily absorb, but also easily washed by water==
### Flue gas desulphrization
#### wet desulfurization(To be confirmed) #TBC
$$
\begin{gathered}
\text{Method 1:}\\
\ce{ SO_{2} + Ca(OH)2 -> CaSO_{3} + H_{2}O }\\
\\
\text{Method 2:}\\
1. \ce{ SO_{2} + H_{2}O \rightleftharpoons H_{2}SO_{3} }\\
2. \ce{ H_{2}SO3 + CaCO_{3} -> CaSO_{3} + CO_{2} + H2}\\
\\
\ce{ CaSO_{3} }\text{ is water insolube and we can seperate by filtration}

\end{gathered}
$$

#### Dry desulfrization(To be confirmed) #TBC #WIP
1. Absorption
2. Oxidation
   We want to get $\displaystyle\ce{ CaSO_{4} }$ which more stable than $\displaystyle\ce{CaSO_{3} }$ 
3. crystalization

First, absorb the $\displaystyle\ce{ SO_{2} }$ by solid absorbent and seperate out $\displaystyle\ce{ SO_{2} }$
