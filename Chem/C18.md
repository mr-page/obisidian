# Energy change in chemical reaction  
Any reaction included the energy change although the temperature might not change 
break bond and form bond lead to absorb and release heat 

## Exothermic nature of neutralization

The heat given out from the neutralization between any strong acid and any strong alkaline is almost constant($\displaystyle\ce{ 57.3kJ mol^{-1} }\text{ for one mole }\ce{ H+ }\text{ and }\ce{ OH- }$)  
$$
\ce{ H+(aq) + OH-(aq) -> H_{2}O(\l) }
$$

if the mole ratio of $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$ and $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$ is 1:1, for per mol of $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$ and $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$, $\displaystyle\ce{ 57.3kJ }$ heat released.

From alternative side, if the mole number of $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$ and $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$ are different, the number take the lesser one.
