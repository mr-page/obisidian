# Energy change in chemical reaction  
Any reaction included the energy change although the temperature might not change 
break bond and form bond lead to absorb and release heat 

## Exothermic nature of neutralization 
#Exothermic

The heat given out from the neutralization between any strong acid and any strong alkaline is almost constant($\displaystyle\ce{ 57.3kJ mol^{-1} }\text{ for one mole }\ce{ H+ }\text{ and }\ce{ OH- }$)  
$$
\ce{ H+(aq) + OH-(aq) -> H_{2}O(\ell) }
$$

if the mole ratio of $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$ and $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$ is 1:1, for per mol of $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$ and $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$, $\displaystyle\ce{ 57.3kJ }$ heat released.

From alternative side, if the mole number of $\displaystyle\ce{ H+ }$ and $\displaystyle\ce{ OH- }$ are different, the number take the lesser one.

Don't pick too diluted or concentrated solution in experiment 

Be quick to prevent heat loss


### Measurement of heat release
Measure the time of solution for few minute to ==ensure the solution at same initial temperature.==

The container should be poor heat container(e.g. Expanded polystyrene cup)

Use the same thermometer

THe bulb of termometer completely immerse in the solution and don't touch the wall or bottom of container 

> [!NOTE]
> The amount of energy released by weak acid/alkaline will be lesser since apart of them used to complete ionization in water.

## Soluble salt 

### Insoluble base or carbonate involoved 

Method : action of an acid on a metal, an insoluble base or an insoluble carbonate 

> [!EXAMPLE]
> $\displaystyle\ce{ Mg(s) + H_{2}SO_{4}(aq) -> MgSO_{4}(aq) + H_{2}(g) }$
> 
> $\displaystyle\ce{ MgO(s) + H_{2}SO_{4}(aq) -> MgSO_{4}(aq) + h_{2}O(\ell) }$
> 
> $\displaystyle\ce{MgCO_{3}(s) + H_{2}SO_{4}(aq) -> MgSO_{4}(aq) + CO_{2}(g) + H_{2}O(\ell) }$


1. Add the acid and base together and stir the reaction mixture with a glass rod. 
2. Heat the reaction mixture gently to speed up (optional)
3. Add the insoluble base until some remains undissolved
4. ==Filter off the excess== insoluble base. The filtrate is product solution
5. Heat the solutioni until it beomces saturated
   If ask for ==crystal==
6. Crystallization
7. Filter the residual solution to obtain the crystal
8. Wash with ==a little cold distilled water==[^1]
9. Dry with filter paper
   If ask for ==solid==
10. Evaporate the filtrate solution to dry
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Excess acid has to be added

### Soluble base or carbonate involved 

Method : action of an acid on an alkali or a soluble carbonate 

1. Place a a fixed volume of soluble alkali solution in a conical
2. Add a few drops of suitable acid-alkaline indicator
3. Fill the burette with dilute acid 
4. Run the dilute acid from the burette into the coincal flask until the solution in the flask just colour change.
5. ==Record the volume of dilute acid required to completely neutralize== the sodium hydroxide solution
6. Repated Steps 1 to 3 with exactly the same volumes of acid and alkali needed for complete neutralization. ==DON'T ADD ACID-ALKLINE INDICATOR==
7. Heat the solution until it becomes saturated
8. Leave the saturated solution aside to cool slowly to room temperature. Crystal will form after some time
9. Filter the crystals from the residual solution
10. Wash the crystals with a ==little cold distilled water==[^1]
11. Dry the crystal with filter paper
> [!EXAMPLE]
> $\displaystyle\ce{ NaOH(aq) +  HCl(aq) -> NaCl(aq)  + H_{2}O(\ell)}$
> 
> $\displaystyle\ce{ Na_{2}CO_{3}(aq) + 2HCl(aq) -> 2NaCl(aq) + CO_{2}(g) + H_{2}O(\ell) }$


### Why two different method 
> [!EXAMPLE]
> To prepare $\displaystyle\ce{ CaSO_{4}(s) }$:
> 
> $\displaystyle\ce{ Ca(NO_{3})2(aq) + Na_{2}SO_{4}(s) -> CaSO_{4}(s) + 2NaNO_{3}(aq)}$✓
> 
> $\displaystyle\ce{ CaCO_{3}(s) + H_{2}SO_{4}(aq) -> CaSO_{4} + CO_{2}(g) + H_{2}O(\ell) }$ ✕
> 
> This will due to low purity of product:
> 
> Layer of water insoluble $\displaystyle\ce{ CaSO_{4} }$ formed on $\displaystyle\ce{ CaSO_{4} }$ surface, prevent $\displaystyle\ce{ CaCO_{3} }$ underneath from further reaction.  Low purity of $\displaystyle\ce{ CaSO_{4} }$  obtained

## Insoluble salt 

Method : Precipitation

> [!EXAMPLE]
> $\displaystyle\ce{ Pb(NO_{3})2(aq) + Na_{2}SO_{4}(aq) -> PbSO_{4}(s) + 2NaNO_{3}(aq)}$
> 
> $\displaystyle\ce{ PbSO_{4} }$ is white precipitate

1. Mix acid and soluble alkali together, a precipitate of product will form
2. Filter the reaction mixture to obtain the precipitate 
3. Wash the precipiatie with ==distilled water== [^1]
4. Dry with filter paper or in an oven[^2]
