# Energy change in chemical reaction  
Any reaction includes energy change although the temperature might not change.  
Breaking bonds and forming bonds lead to absorption and release of heat.

## Exothermic nature of neutralization 
#Exothermic

The heat given out from the neutralization between any strong acid and any strong alkali is almost constant ($\displaystyle\ce{57.3 kJ mol^{-1}}$ for one mole $\displaystyle\ce{H+}$ and $\displaystyle\ce{OH-}$).  
$$
\ce{H+(aq) + OH-(aq) -> H2O(l)}
$$

If the mole ratio of $\displaystyle\ce{H+}$ and $\displaystyle\ce{OH-}$ is 1:1, for each mole of $\displaystyle\ce{H+}$ and $\displaystyle\ce{OH-}$, $\displaystyle\ce{57.3 kJ}$ heat is released.

Alternatively, if the mole numbers of $\displaystyle\ce{H+}$ and $\displaystyle\ce{OH-}$ are different, use the lesser value.

Don't use too diluted or concentrated solutions in experiments.

Work quickly to prevent heat loss.

### Measurement of heat release
Measure the temperature of solution for a few minutes to ==ensure the solution reaches the same initial temperature==.

The container should be a poor heat conductor (e.g. expanded polystyrene cup).

Use the same thermometer.

The bulb of thermometer should be completely immersed in the solution and not touch the wall or bottom of container.

> [!NOTE]
> The amount of energy released by weak acid/alkali will be less since part of the energy is used for complete ionization in water.

## Soluble salt 

### Insoluble base or carbonate involved 

Method: action of an acid on a metal, an insoluble base or an insoluble carbonate.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> $\displaystyle\ce{Mg(s) + H2SO4(aq) -> MgSO4(aq) + H2(g)}$
> 
> $\displaystyle\ce{MgO(s) + H2SO4(aq) -> MgSO4(aq) + H2O(l)}$
> 
> $\displaystyle\ce{MgCO3(s) + H2SO4(aq) -> MgSO4(aq) + CO2(g) + H2O(l)}$

1. Add the acid and base together and stir the reaction mixture with a glass rod.
2. Heat the reaction mixture gently to speed up (optional)
3. Add the insoluble base until some remains undissolved
4. ==Filter off the excess== insoluble base. The filtrate is the product solution.
5. Heat the solution until it becomes saturated.
   If asking for ==crystals==:
6. Crystallization
7. Filter the residual solution to obtain the crystals
8. Wash with ==a little cold distilled water==[^1]
9. Dry with filter paper
   If asking for ==solid==:
10. Evaporate the filtrate solution to dryness

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Excess acid must be added.

### Soluble base or carbonate involved 

Method: action of an acid on an alkali or a soluble carbonate.

1. Place a fixed volume of soluble alkali solution in a conical flask
2. Add a few drops of suitable acid-base indicator
3. Fill the burette with dilute acid
4. Run the dilute acid from the burette into the conical flask until the solution just changes color
5. ==Record the volume of dilute acid required to completely neutralize== the sodium hydroxide solution
6. Repeat Steps 1 to 3 with exactly the same volumes of acid and alkali needed for complete neutralization. ==DO NOT ADD ACID-BASE INDICATOR==
7. Heat the solution until it becomes saturated
8. Leave the saturated solution aside to cool slowly to room temperature. Crystals will form after some time
9. Filter the crystals from the residual solution
10. Wash the crystals with ==a little cold distilled water==[^1]
11. Dry the crystals with filter paper

> [!EXAMPLE]
> $\displaystyle\ce{NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) -> NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)}$
> 
> $\displaystyle\ce{Na2CO3(aq) + 2HCl(aq) -> 2NaCl(aq) + CO2(g) + H2O(l)}$

### Why two different methods?
> [!EXAMPLE]
> To prepare $\displaystyle\ce{CaSO4(s)}$:
> 
> $\displaystyle\ce{Ca(NO3)2(aq) + Na2SO4(aq) -> CaSO4(s) + 2NaNO3(aq)}$ ✓
> 
> $\displaystyle\ce{CaCO3(s) + H2SO4(aq) -> CaSO4(s) + CO2(g) + H2O(l)}$ ✕
> 
> This results in low product purity because:
> 
> A layer of water-insoluble $\displaystyle\ce{CaSO4}$ forms on the $\displaystyle\ce{CaCO3}$ surface, preventing further reaction. Low purity $\displaystyle\ce{CaSO4}$ is obtained.
 
## Insoluble salt 

Method: Precipitation

> [!EXAMPLE]
> $\displaystyle\ce{Pb(NO3)2(aq) + Na2SO4(aq) -> PbSO4(s) + 2NaNO3(aq)}$
> 
> $\displaystyle\ce{PbSO4}$ is a white precipitate.

1. Mix solutions to form precipitate
2. Filter to obtain precipitate
3. Wash with ==distilled water== [^1]
4. Dry with filter paper or in oven[^2]
