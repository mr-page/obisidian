>$\displaystyle\ce{ Al_{2}O_{3} }$ burns to produce White powder\
>$\displaystyle\ce{ ZnO }$ burns to produce powder(Hot:yellow,Cold,White) \
$\displaystyle\ce{ Fe_{3}O_{4} }$ burns with yellow sparks to produce black solid\

# Reactions of metals with water 
## Action of water on K, Na, Ca
K,NA,Ca both react with 'cold water'
$$\ce{ Metal + water -> Metal Hydroxide + hydrogen }$$K and Na vigorously react with cold water ,
Ca react with a moderate rate.

K and Na will fully dissolved into water, colourless gas bubbles given out and the ==solution become warmer. The lilac or golden yellow flame will be given out.== 
$\displaystyle\ce{ Ca(OH)2 }$ is slightly dissolved in water. It will turn solution become milky, given out colourless gas bubbles and solution become warmer.  The $\displaystyle\ce{ Ca(OH)2 }$ produced on Ca surface will stop the further reaction of Ca and water so the Ca will not fully dissolved into the water .
Ps: $\displaystyle\ce{ Ca(OH)2 }$ is corrosive
All the colourless gas bubbles given out is hydrogen gas 

# Action of steam on Mg , Al , Zn and Fe
==Al doesn't not react with steam since it has high corrosion resistance==
 Metal oxides and hydrogen are produced in the reaction
 $$\displaystyle\ce{  Metal + Steam -> Metal oixde + Hydrogen}$$
  > [!TIP]
>  On strong heating, the water in the wet sand becomes steam

The steam react with hot magnesium to give an ==intense white light and form white solid($\displaystyle\ce{ MgO }$)==

# Reaction of metal with acid
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Copper(Cu), Mercury(Hg),Silver(Ag),Platinum(Pt) do not react with dilute acid 

$$
\begin{gathered}
\ce{ metal + dilute hydrocholoric acid -> metal chloride + hydrogen }\\
\ce{ metal + dilute sulphuric acid -> metal sulphate + hydrogen }
\end{gathered}
$$

==The metal is dissolved in the acid and colourless gas bubbles are given out==

# Metal reactivity series
The metal reactivity series compared by:
- The ==lowest temperature at which the reaction start(support sufficient energy)==
- The rate of reaction
- The amount of heat given out in the reaction
## reactivity and readiness to lose electrons 

![[Pasted image 20250105152626.png]]
==The readiness of the metal atoms to lose electrons decrease when moving across a period== 
==The readiness of the metal to lose electrons increases moving down a group==

> [!SUMMARY]
> A metal higher in the reactivity series s more reactive , and its atoms would lose electrons to form positive ions more readliy.
# Displacement reactions of metal

## Reaction between $\displaystyle\ce{ Cu }$ and $\displaystyle\ce{ AgNO_{3}(aq) }$  
Put copper in silver nitrate solution, the copper slowly dissolves. Some shiny silver from on the copper surface. 
$$\displaystyle\ce{ Cu(s) + 2AgNO_{3}(aq) -> Cu(NO_{3})_{2}(aq) + 2Ag(s)) }$$
==$\displaystyle\ce{ Cu^{2}+ }$ turns the solution gradually turns pale blue
Copper is higher than silver in the metal reactivity series, 
so copper lose electrons more readily than silver.
Thus, copper atoms lose electrons to become $\displaystyle\ce{ Cu^{2}+ }$ while $\displaystyle\ce{ Ag^{2}+ }$ gains electrons to become silver atoms==

> [!SUMMARY]
> A more reactive metal will ==displace== any ==less reactive metal from an aqueous solution== of the compound of the less reactive metal.
## Reaction between $\displaystyle\ce{ Zn }$ and $\displaystyle\ce{ CuO }$ 
Zinc is more reactive than copper. so it will displace copper from $\displaystyle\ce{ CuO }$ 
$$
\ce{ Zn(s) + CuO(s) -> ZNO(s) + Cu(s) }
$$
> [!SUMMARY]
> A more reactive metal will displace the less reactive metal from its oxides
# Ion equations
Consider the displacement reaction between copper and silver nitrate solution again.
It's chemical equation for reaction is 
$$\displaystyle\ce{ Cu(s) + 2AgNO_{3}(aq) -> Cu(NO_{3})_{2}(aq) + 2Ag(s)) }$$
Both silver nitrate and copper(II) Nitrate are ionic compounds which are soluble in water. 
Bot silver nitrate and copper(II) nitrate exist as mobile ions

We can rewrite the above chemical  equation showing the mobile ions present:
$$
\ce{ Cu(s) + \underbrace{ 2Ag+(aq) + 2NO_{3}-(aq) }_{ silve nitrate solution }-> C\underbrace{ u^{2}+(aq) + 2NO_{3}-(aq) }_{ Copper nitrate solution } 2Ag(s) }
$$
Note that nitrate ions do not take part in the reaction and known as ==spectator ions==(Ps: spectator ion must be mobile ion)
By cancelling out the spectator ions form the equation, we get:
$$
\ce{ Cu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) -> Cu^{2}+(aq) + 2Ag(s) }
$$
This equation called an ==ionic equation==
The ==net charge== of the both side of ionic equation are the same
> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
==If no spectator ion present, no ion equation==\
The spectator ion must be molten or aqueous state [[Solubility of Ionic compound]]

> [!SUMMARY]
> An ionic equation is a chemical equation which ==includes only those ions that form or are changed during a reaction==




# Classification of metal
The classification of different metal by react with cold water , steam , acid or metal ion solution
> [!EXAMPLE]
> To classify the $\displaystyle\ce{ Na,Fe,Ag }$, firstly put all metal in the cold water, only $\displaystyle\ce{ Na }$ would react with cold water with gas bubble given out and ==golden yellow flame given out.== 
> 
Remain metal no observable change
>
For $\displaystyle\ce{ Ag and Fe  }$
>
==Add $\displaystyle\ce{ Fe and Ag  }$ into the $\displaystyle\ce{ AgNO_{3} }$ solution separately==,
>
 since $\displaystyle\ce{ Fe }$ is more reactive than $\displaystyle\ce{ Ag }$.$\displaystyle\therefore$ the $\displaystyle\ce{ Fe }$ can displace the $\displaystyle\ce{ Ag }$ from $\displaystyle\ce{ AgNO_{3} (aq)}$ , the solution change from colourless to blue( presence of $\displaystyle\ce{ Fe^{2}+ }$) 
>
For $\displaystyle\ce{ Ag }$ , do not give out observable change
## Chemical test

> ==Chemical reactions are not involved the flame test==
