# Distillation
## Test of distillate
Boil at 100°C (boiling point test)
## water in and out 
Lowe opening and upper opening
## Anti-bumping granule
Use for prevent bumping due to overheat of the sea water
# Flame test
==Moisten a clean platinum or nichrome wire with concentrate hydrochloric acid==
Dip the wire into a crushed simple to test
Heat the end of wire in a non-luminous flame

Potassium : Lilac \
Sodium : Golden yellow\
Calcium : Brick-red\
Copper : Bluish green


# Silver nitrate test
To indicate chloride existence\
Dissolve sample in deionized water \
add excess dilute nitric acid and ==Acidified silver nitrate solution==\
If white precipitate form\
Chloride existed

# Water test
#Water
> [!IMPORTANT]
==Anhydrous copper(II) : White → blue==\
==Dry cobalt(II) chloride paper : blue → pink==
Show the presence of wate 

# Electrolysis of sea water and sue of product 

Electrolysis means decomposition by electricity

Hydrogen as forms at the forms at the positive electrode 
The remain solution becomes sodium hydroxide$\displaystyle\ce{ NaOH (aq)}$ 

## Use of product 
### Hydrogen
- Making margarine
- Making ammonia 
- As rocket fuel
- Making hydrochloric acid $\displaystyle\ce{ HCl }$ 

### Chlorine 
- ==Sterilizing== swimming pool water 
- Making PV
- Making chlorin bleach
- smell choking
#### Sodium Hydroxide 
- ==Making soap==
- Making drain cleaner 
- Neutralizing acidic effluent from factory
